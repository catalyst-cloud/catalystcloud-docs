Audit Logs
#############

Audit Logs, provide users with the ability to monitor several
important details about their project through the use of auditable API logs.
These logs include information about who has issued a command to your project,
when that command was issued and what changes were made because of that
command. This allows you to keep track of any changes made to your project and
identify exactly how they were made and who made them.

This ability to track the information around what actions are performed on a
project, allows you to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the status of
the systems you build on the Catalyst Cloud.
