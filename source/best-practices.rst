The following is the best practice section for the Catalyst Cloud
documentation. The following documents cover more than the best practices that
pertain to just the Catalyst Cloud. The general best practice pages
contain information useful to use in a wider context. We highly
recommend reading through these sections before progressing further as the
practices contained in them relate to all services you will find on the
Catalyst Cloud.
