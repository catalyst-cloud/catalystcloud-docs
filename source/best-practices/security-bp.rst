This section covers some best practices for security on the Catalyst Cloud, and
for general security business standards in the tech sector today.

Password protocols
******************

Password strength is defined by the entropy it has.
This is to say how long it takes to brute force your password. If you have a
relatively long password you would be fine. However, your passwords entropy,
goes down significantly if you use common keywords such as 'password' or
a birthday date. To ensure that your password entropy is high, a standard has
formed around passwords so that they comply with these rules:

- It is at least 18 characters in length where possible, or if a service
  only allows shorter, you should use the maximum amount of characters.
- It should contain at least one capital letter, one number and one special
  character (e.g. @,&,-,~,!)
- Do not use certain words in a password such as: Password, Secret, '123456',
  p@ssw0rd etc.

OR if you are using a passphrase instead:

- It should contain at least 4 words and be over 18 characters long.

Using a passphrase (a collection of words), rather than a password with
different symbols and numbers is also possible. The length of a
passphrase gives it the necessary entropy to be a viable alternative with the
added benefit  that you will be able to remember 4-6 words easier
than you would 18 randomly generated characters.

.. code-block:: bash

   # an example of a complex password would be
   deyp78&*fasbk!~)&(*

   # an example of a strong passphrase would be
   boat drill charger keys stop
   # this could be more specific and meaningful to you, or random like the one above

The last thing about passwords that you need to be considerate of, is password
protection. Follow these rules about access to or sharing information
about passwords:

- Don't send your password over the internet to anyone.
- Don't write passwords down and store them on a physical location.
- Store any user ID's or passwords in an encrypted format.
- Do not script any passwords for automatic log in.
- Never use a previously used password.
- Change your password once every year.

Another thing to note about passwords:

If you ever need to send the output of some code to a support staff member and
that code contains a password or other sensitive information; Be sure that you
censor the password before sending it, as done below.

.. code-block:: bash

  OS_AUTH_URL=https://api.cloud.catalyst.net.nz:5000/v3
  OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_ID=default
  OS_REGION_NAME=nz_wlg_2
  OS_PROJECT_NAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
  OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
  OS_INTERFACE=public
  OS_USERNAME=XXXXXXXXXXXXX@catalyst.net.nz
  OS_PROJECT_ID=fha98835bhnae8092n4388ujf
  OS_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXXXXXX

********************
Update systems often
********************

Keeping your software up to date with the most current version of
your applications and operating systems helps to keep you secure. Malicious
software that attacks files and core operating infrastructure on your
computer is consistently created; therefore your operating system and other
applications need to be constantly updated to protect yourself. It is
understandable that if you are using a legacy program or software that you may
not be able to update it but for those that you can, it is recommended you
keep them updated as regularly as possible. These updates usually include
upgrades dealing with security a large portion of the time.

*****************
Encrypting emails
*****************

When sending emails that pertain to sensitive information,
they should be encrypted using a PGP key or some other form of encryption. This
not only means that it's harder for your emails to be broken into, it also
mitigates phishing attacks because your emails can be authenticated.

You should *never* send any form of private key or identification information
over emails that are not encrypted. In some cases you may need to use a
physical memory device (flash drive) to transport highly sensitive files.

*****************
Access management
*****************

Access management, is a set of practices and rules that make
sure that your organisation knows exactly who has access to the resources that
you have previsioned in the cloud and what exactly these users can do with
said resources.
The Catalyst Cloud achieves a strong level of security in this regard by
the use of **Roles**. These are given to users by the project administrator and
they impose restrictions or provide privileges to users. For more information
on roles and their uses, please see the
:ref:`identity access management <identity-access-management>` section of the
documentation.

***************
Security groups
***************

Security groups are what allow you to safely and securely access the instances
that you create on the Catalyst Cloud. When creating a security group, it
automatically has the following rules:

.. image:: assets/security-group-screenshot.png

These mean that the security group can access the internet from IPv4 and v6
with outward bound traffic. But at this stage there is no ingress traffic, you
must define that yourself. When doing so you need to be careful and understand
the type of access you wish to permit. Below is pictured the different rules
you can create to meet your needs.

.. image:: assets/rule-types.png

The standard that we use at Catalyst is an SSH key pair which you can upload or
create via the dashboard. We use SSH keys because they provide an increased
level of security beyond restricting ports. The full process of how to create
or upload your SSH keys is documented
:ref:`here <first-instance-with-dashboard>`.

.. Warning::
   When creating an ingress rule for the security group you need to be careful
   about which ports you allow access to your instance on. Setting your port range
   to 0.0.0.0./0 will open it to the entire internet meaning that
   anyone should they find it can access your instance. The best practice for a
   secure instance is to use an SSH rule. This is because even should you expose
   it to the entire internet, without the proper SSH key pair, they would not be
   able to access the instance.

**************************
Resource and object naming
**************************

When deciding on the names you are going to give your resources, it is important
to note that the resource names you choose will be logged in our internal logs,
audit logs and are included on the invoices we send to you. Object names stored
in our Object storage system will be logged in our logging and audit logs.

It is recommended that you don't use any sensitive, or personally identifiable
information in either your resource names or object names.
