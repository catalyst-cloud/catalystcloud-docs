Why do the amounts shown by the billing script differ from the dashboard?
*************************************************************************

GST is not included in the billing script when doing separated billing,
however it is included in the dashboard costs.

Why are my stopped compute instances still incurring charges?
*************************************************************

Unless an instance has been ``SHELVED`` it will continue to incur compute
charges. See :ref:`stopping compute` for more information.
