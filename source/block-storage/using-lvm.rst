Creating volumes using LVM
##########################


What is LVM?
------------

The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a user space tool set designed to provide a
higher level management of disk storage on a linux system than the traditional
approach of disks and partitions. This is achieved by creating a software
abstraction of those physical devices.

This virtualization of the disks provides the following benefits:

-  The ability to create single logical volumes from multiple physical
   volumes or entire disks.
-  Management of large disk clusters by allowing hot swappable disks to be
   added and replaced without service downtime.
-  Allows for easy filesystem resizing without having to migrate data.
-  Create filesystem backups by taking snapshots of logical volumes.


Working with logical volumes
============================

While it is possible to create a logical volume using an un-partitioned disk we
recommend that you use a partitioned one, if for no other reason than to inform
software such as partitioning utilities that the disk is being used. This
avoids the possibility of someone firing up a partitioning program, seeing an
un-partitioned disk and attempting to use it for some other purpose.

Creating a logical volume on a single disk
------------------------------------------
The first thing to do is identify the disks available for use, to do this
use ``lvmdiskscan`` while on a **compute instance**; and while having ``Sudo``
privileges.

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# lvmdiskscan
    /dev/vda1 [      11.00 GiB]
    /dev/vdb  [      10.00 GiB]
    /dev/vdc  [      10.00 GiB]
    2 disks
    1 partition
    0 LVM physical volume whole disks
    0 LVM physical volumes

This shows us that there are currently three disks available

- /dev/vda1, which is a partition on the disk /dev/vda
- /dev/vdb and /dev/vdc, which are un-partitioned disks

For this example /dev/vdb will be used to create the logical volume.

There are several tools available for creating disk partitions, these include
tools such as fdisk, parted and the GNU parted. This example will use gdisk
and the steps are as follows:

- load gdisk and select the disk to partition
- type **n** to create a new partition
- accept the defaults for partition number, first sector and last sector
- type **L** to list the available partition types
- type **8e00** to select Linux LVM
- type **p** to view the partition information
- type **v** to verify the integrity of the changes
- type **w** to write the changes to disk

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# gdisk

  Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
  PARTITIONS!!

  Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
  OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/vdb.
  The operation has completed successfully.

Now checking the disk status should show that there is a new partition

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# lvmdiskscan
    /dev/vda1 [      11.00 GiB]
    /dev/vdb1 [      10.00 GiB]
    /dev/vdc  [      10.00 GiB]
    1 disk
    2 partitions
    0 LVM physical volume whole disks
    0 LVM physical volumes

In order to use a storage device in a logical volume the disks must first be
labelled as LVM physical volumes, this can be done this using **pvcreate**.
While there is only /dev/vdb1 being added at this time it is possible to pass
multiple devices at once.

The **pvs** (or **pvdisplay**) command can then be used to confirm the status
of the available physical volumes.

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# pvcreate /dev/vdb1
  Physical volume "/dev/vdb1" successfully created

  root@lvm-test:~# pvs
  PV         VG   Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree
  /dev/vdb1       lvm2 ---  10.00g 10.00g

The next step is to create a volume group. Once again, though only a single
initial physical volume is being added it is possible to add multiple physical
volumes at a time.

It is possible to use a single volume group per server to create a pool of LVM
managed storage, and then allocate all logical volumes from that. Some possible
scenarios where multiple volume groups are necessary are:

- to achieve a sense of separation between operating system and user disks.
- a need for disks with different extent sizes.
- isolating data for performance reasons

Multiple volume groups also require separate physical groups as they cannot be
shared across volume groups.

Using **vgcreate**, create the volume group. If no value is provided for the
extents it will use the default of 4MiB. Volume group status can be confirmed
using vgs (or vgdisplay).

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# vgcreate vg_data /dev/vdb1
  Volume group "vg_data" successfully created

  root@lvm-test:~# vgs
  VG      #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
  vg_data   1   0   0 wz--n- 10.00g 10.00g

The final step is to create a new logical volume using the **lvcreate** command
, we will call it 'data' and create it in the volume group 'vg_data'.

In the output above it shows that the volume group has 10GB available. That
means that a logical volume could be created with any size up to that limit.
To create a 5GB partition for instance, specify the the size argument ``-l 5G``
. For this example the new volume will use all of the available free space with
the following parameter ``-l 100%FREE``.

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n data vg_data
    Logical volume "test" created.

  root@lvm-test:~# lvdisplay
    --- Logical volume ---
    LV Path                /dev/vg_data/data
    LV Name                test
    VG Name                vg_data
    LV UUID                LECR2H-OKRK-lPCG-voU1-HCWw-fdTZ-JXcAHc
    LV Write Access        read/write
    LV Creation host, time lvm-test, 2018-02-07 00:21:10 +0000
    LV Status              available
    # open                 0
    LV Size                10.00 GiB
    Current LE             2559
    Segments               1
    Allocation             inherit
    Read ahead sectors     auto
    - currently set to     256
    Block device           252:0

Running **lvmdiskscan** now should show that the new LVM volume is present.

.. code-block:: shell

    root@lvm-test:~# lvmdiskscan
      /dev/vg_data/test [      10.00 GiB]
      /dev/vda1         [      11.00 GiB]
      /dev/vdb1         [      10.00 GiB] LVM physical volume
      /dev/vdc          [      10.00 GiB]
      2 disks
      1 partition
      0 LVM physical volume whole disks
      1 LVM physical volume

All that remains to be done now is to add a filesystem to the LVM volume and
create a mount point and a mount point entry in /etc/fstab and test that the
volume mounts correctly.

.. code-block:: shell

  root@lvm-test:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_data/data
