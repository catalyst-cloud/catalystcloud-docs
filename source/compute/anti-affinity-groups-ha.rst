Anti-affinity groups for HA

..
  Affinity and anti-affinity groups allow you to ensure compute instances are
  placed on the same or different hypervisors (physical servers).

Anti-affinity groups allow you to ensure compute instances are placed on
different physical servers.

..
  Server affinity is useful when you want to ensure that the data transfer
  amongst compute instances is as fast as possible. On the other hand it may
  reduce the availability of your application (a single server going down
  affects all compute instances in the group) or increase CPU contention.

Server anti-affinity is useful when you want to increase the availability of an
application within a region and create redundancy for your compute instances.
Compute instances in an anti-affinity group are placed on different physical
servers, ensuring that the failure of a server will not affect all your compute
instances simultaneously.

    .. tab:: Openstack CLI

      To create a server group:

      .. code-block:: bash

        openstack server group create --policy $policy $groupname

      Where:

      * ``$groupname`` is a name you choose (eg: app-servers)
      * ``$policy`` is ``anti-affinity``

      .. * ``$policy`` is either ``affinity`` or ``anti-affinity``

      To list server groups:

      .. code-block:: bash

        openstack server group list

      To delete a server group:

      .. code-block:: bash

        openstack server group delete $groupid

      Deleting a server group does not delete the compute instances that belong to
      the group.

      |

      Adding a compute instance to a server group:

      When launching a compute instance, you can pass a hint to our cloud scheduler
      to indicate it belongs to a server group. This is done using the ``--hint
      group=$GROUP_ID`` parameter, as indicated below.

      .. code-block:: bash

        openstack server create --flavor $CC_FLAVOR_ID --image $CC_IMAGE_ID
        --key-name $KEY_NAME --security-group default --security-group $SEC_GROUP
        --nic net-id=$CC_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ID --hint group=$GROUP_ID first-instance

      .. note::

        If you receive a `No valid host was found` error, it means that the cloud
        scheduler could not find a suitable server to honour the policy of the server
        group. For example, we may not have enough capacity on the same hypervisor to
        place another instance in affinity, or enough hypervisors with sufficient
        capacity to place instances in anti-affinity.

    .. tab:: Ansible

      The example below illustrates how the ``server group hint`` can be passed
      in an Ansible playbook using the os_server module. This means when the
      playbook creates a compute instance, it also puts it into the desired
      server group:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: Create a compute instance on the Catalyst Cloud
          os_server:
            state: present
            name: "{{ instance_name }}"
            image: "{{ image }}"
            key_name: "{{ keypair_name }}"
            flavor: "{{ flavor }}"
            nics:
              - net-name: "{{ private_network_name }}"
            security_groups: "default,{{ security_group_name }}"
            scheduler_hints: "group=78f2aabc-e73a-4c72-88fd-79185797548c"
