****************
Cloning the repo
****************

Go to https://github.com/catalyst/catalystcloud-docs and fork the docs to your
own account on GitHub.

Clone the docs::

  git clone https://github.com/catalyst-cloud/catalystcloud-docs.git
  cd catalystcloud-docs

Create a new topic branch for your contribution (choose a sensible name)::

  git checkout -b new/fantastic-content#9999

Sync your branch with GitHub::

  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> new/fantastic-content#9999

.. note::

  Branch naming convention: ``new|bug|?/<shortdesc>#<ticket-num>``

  Branch names starts with "new" or "bug". New is used when adding a new
  document or new sections to existing documents. Bug is using when amending
  content of an existing document.

  ``<shortdesc>``: is something brief that indicates what the change is.

  ``<ticket-num>``: is optional and indicates the ticket number that the change
  is related to.

*************************************
Making your changes and contributions
*************************************

When you'd like to make changes to the content, you can see your changes by
running the ``live_compile.sh`` script in the root directory::

  cd catalystcloud-docs
  ./live_compile.sh

Then navigate to ``localhost:8000`` to see the results of your changes. As you
save files, the changes will appear in your browser.

If you are adding a new document, you may want to add it to the index.rst, so
that people can find it when navigating the docs.

If you're using the `Atom text editor <https://atom.io/>`_, we recommend
installing the `Sphinx language <https://atom.io/packages/language-sphinx>`_
package, and making extensive use of the Reflow selection command
(``Shift+Ctrl+Q``).

When done::

  git add source/*
  git commit

.. note::

  If you want to be sure your documentation will work correctly, you can use
  :ref:`git hooks <doc-git-hooks>` documented below to check that the
  documentation will compile before it is committed.

Push the changes back to your personal branch::

  git push origin your-branch-name
