The web dashboard is a simple and convenient way to interact with Catalyst
Cloud. It can be found at https://dashboard.catalystcloud.nz.

The dashboard provides a friendly and simplified interface for commonly used
services and functionality available on Catalyst Cloud. There are however
more advanced features that are only available via the :ref:`Command Line
Interface (CLI) <command-line-interface>` or by interacting with our :ref:`APIs
<apis>`.

.. note::

  When a new feature is introduced to Catalyst Cloud, it is first exposed
  via a REST API, followed by the Command Line Interface and finally the web
  dashboard. It usually takes a few months for it to reach the dashboard.

The major appeal of using the dashboard is it requires no programming expertise
or familiarity with command line tools. Another advantage is that the dashboard
is accessible from anywhere (not restricted to specific IP addresses like the
APIs).
