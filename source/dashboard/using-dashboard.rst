Using the dashboard
###################

There is an assumed level of understanding about the nature of the services you
are interacting with. That said, most users should be able to achieve their
desired outcomes by simply navigating through and playing around with the
dashboard.

You can see the services provided on the left-hand sidebar. Each service has a
corresponding section in this documentation, with their own guides and
tutorials. If this is your first time interacting with our services, we
recommend you going through our :ref:`first instance tutorial
<launch-first-instance>`.

Some of the dashboard functionality beyond these services are in the buttons
along the top bar. From left to right, they let you:

* Select which project you are working on;
* Change what region your operating in;
* Access our support functions;
* Change accounts or access your account settings.
