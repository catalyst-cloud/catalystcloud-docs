The database service provides the same functionality that you are used to with
databases, while providing the benefits that come from the on demand nature of
the cloud. The main feature of the database service is the fact that we are
able to separate the database instance itself from the types of databases that
you are able to choose from. As it is now, you are able to use a database
instance to host multiple databases systems. This is discussed later in the
documentation.
