The database service provides the same functionality that you are used to with
traditional databases, while also implementing the benefits that come from the
on demand nature of the cloud. The main feature of the database service is the
fact that we are able to separate the database instance itself from the types
of databases that you are able to choose from. Meaning that you are able to
host multiple database systems from the same *database instance.* This is
discussed later in the documentation.


.. Warning::

  This service is currently only available to invited users as a tech preview.
