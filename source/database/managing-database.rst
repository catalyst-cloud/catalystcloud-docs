Managing your databases
#######################

This section covers the ways that you are able to manage the different aspects
of your database instances. These include configuring who has access to
your instances, managing the size and flavor of your instances and how to
activate and track the logging of your instances.
This section follows on from the previous example in 'creating your database.'
It references the instance that was made in that example.

******************
Configuring access
******************

.. Note::

  Users can't access the underlying compute instance that the database lies on,
  they can only access the database if they have permissions. This is for
  security purposes.


If a user was not added when the instance was created then the only
user account that exists is the ``root`` user. However this is disabled by
default.

We can confirm this is the case by doing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database root show db-instance-1
  +-----------------+-------+
  | Field           | Value |
  +-----------------+-------+
  | is_root_enabled | False |
  +-----------------+-------+

To enable the root login, run the following command against your database
instance.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database root enable db-instance-1
  +----------+--------------------------------------+
  | Field    | Value                                |
  +----------+--------------------------------------+
  | name     | root                                 |
  | password | XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX |
  +----------+--------------------------------------+

.. Note::

  A random password will be generated for the root user, this will need to be
  noted down as it cannot be retrieved again. If the password is misplaced the
  only option is to re-run the enable command which will generate a new
  random password.

To confirm the root account is now enabled, simply re-run the same command as
above.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database root show db-instance-1
  +-----------------+-------+
  | Field           | Value |
  +-----------------+-------+
  | is_root_enabled | True  |
  +-----------------+-------+

We can check that this has worked if we are able to access the database and run
the following query:

.. code-block:: bash

  $   mysql -h 10.0.0.83 -u root -p -e 'SELECT USER()'
  Enter password:
  +----------------+
  | USER()         |
  +----------------+
  | root@10.0.0.83 |
  +----------------+

Creating new users
==================

While it is possible to create a database user when launching your database
instance (using the ``--users <username>:<password>`` argument) it is more than
likely that further users will need to be added over time.

This can be done using the openstack commandline. Below we can see two example
of how we can add a new user to our myDB database. One example creates a
user that can access the database from any location. This is the same behaviour
that is displayed when the user is created as part of the initial database
instance creation.

The other example uses the ``--host`` argument which creates a user that can
only connect from a specified IP address.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database user create db-instance-1 newuser userpass --databases myDB

  $ openstack database user list db-instance-1
  +---------+-----------+-----------+
  | Name    | Host      | Databases |
  +---------+-----------+-----------+
  | dbusr   | %         | myDB      |
  | newuser | %         | myDB      |
  +---------+-----------+-----------+

  $ openstack database user create db-instance-1 newuser2 userpass2 --host 10.0.0.80 --databases myDB

  $ openstack database user list db-instance-1
  +----------+-----------+-----------+
  | Name     | Host      | Databases |
  +----------+-----------+-----------+
  | dbusr    | %         | myDB      |
  | newuser  | %         | myDB      |
  | newuser2 | 10.0.0.80 | myDB      |
  +----------+-----------+-----------+

Managing user access
====================

Now that we are aware of how to create new users for a database, and we have
previously discussed having multiple databases on our *database instance* we
can discuss how to add or revoke user access to different databases.

Going off of the examples we had before, we created a secondary database named
*myDB2*. The following code block is constructed so that it will allow access
to the database *mydb2* for *newuser2*

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database user grant access db-instance-1 newuser2 myDB2

  # if we now show the access for our user, we will see it has been given access to myDB2
  $ openstack database user show access db-instance-1 newuser2
  +--------+
  | Name   |
  +--------+
  | myDB   |
  | myDB2  |
  +--------+

If we now try to access myDB2 using newuser2 then we should successfully be
able to reach it.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mysql -h IP_ADDRESS -u newuser2 -p myDB2
  Enter password:

While trying to access this database using *newuser* will result in the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mysql -h IP_ADDRESS -u newuser -p myDB2
  Enter password:

  ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'newuser'@'%' to database 'myDB2'

Now that you know how to add access to a user; How do you revoke access from a
user? The following code block will remove the access we gave to *newuser2* and
show you the response we receive when trying to ping the database afterword:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database user revoke access db-instance-1 newuser2 myDB2

  $ mysql -h IP_ADDRESS -u newuser2 -p myDB2
  Enter password:

  ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'newuser2'@'%' to database 'myDB2'

Before moving on let's remove our test users for now.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database user delete db-instance-1 newuser

  $ openstack database user delete db-instance-1 newuser2


**********************
Resizing your database
**********************

After you have created your database instance you may find that you need more
storage space or you require a different flavor type. In these cases you do not
have to create a new database; you can update your current one to match your
sizing requirements. The following section will guide you through how to resize
your instances.

.. Warning::

  Before making changes to the flavor of your instance, you should stop your
  instance and restart it after the resizing has been completed.

The following example will resize the flavor of *db-instance-1* to c1.c2r4

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database instance resize flavor db-instance-1 c1.c2r4

This next code block allows you to resize the volume that you have attached to
your instance. The command is formed similarly to the above command, you choose
your instance and then specify the amount in GB you want your volume to be
resized to. Unlike the previous command you **do not** have to stop your
instance and restart it, however there will be a dip in performance until the
resize is complete.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database instance resize volume db-instance-1 10


.. Note::

  When you upgrade the size of an instance, if it has any replicas; there is an
  option so that they are also upgraded to the same size.

************
Viewing logs
************

Logging is important for keeping a well maintained database. In the following
example we will explain how to publish a slow_query log. These are a
performance log that consists of SQL statements that have taken longer than
the specified long_query_time to execute.

The first thing we have to do is check whether we have logging enabled on our
instance or not.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database log list db-instance-1
  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+
  | Name       | Type | Status   | Published | Pending | Container | Prefix |
  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+
  | slow_query | USER | Disabled |         0 |       0 | None      | None   |
  | general    | USER | Disabled |         0 |       0 | None      | None   |
  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+

At the moment our database instance does not have logging enabled. The
following shows how to enable slow_query specifically.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database log set --enable db-instance-1 slow_query
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Field     | Value                                                          |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | container | None                                                           |
  | metafile  | 6f4e35e6-58fa-4812-a075-3a20a29edd0b/mysql-slow_query_metafile |
  | name      | slow_query                                                     |
  | pending   | 182                                                            |
  | prefix    | None                                                           |
  | published | 0                                                              |
  | status    | Ready                                                          |
  | type      | USER                                                           |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

  # Check to confirm this action

  $ openstack database log list db-instance-1

  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+
  | Name       | Type | Status   | Published | Pending | Container | Prefix |
  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+
  | slow_query | USER | Ready    |         0 |     182 | None      | None   |
  | general    | USER | Disabled |         0 |       0 | None      | None   |
  +------------+------+----------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------+

Finally we publish the log using:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack database log set db-instance-1 --publish slow_query
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Field     | Value                                                          |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | container | database_logs                                                  |
  | metafile  | 6f4e35e6-58fa-4812-a075-3a20a29edd0b/mysql-slow_query_metafile |
  | name      | slow_query                                                     |
  | pending   | 0                                                              |
  | prefix    | 6f4e35e6-58fa-4812-a075-3a20a29edd0b/mysql-slow_query          |
  | published | 404                                                            |
  | status    | Published                                                      |
  | type      | USER                                                           |
  +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

  $ openstack object list database_logs
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Name                                                                                 |
