Using programmatic methods
##########################

After reading the overview, you should have a decent idea of what resources are
required for a compute instance to run and we
can now begin creating a new instance. There are a number of different methods
that you can use to create your instance. These include: using the
dashboard, using different command line tools, or using an orchestration engine
to manage all of the resources you require. The following sections will cover
the different programs or methods you can use, from the command line, to create
an instance.

************
Requirements
************

Before we get started, you will have to source an openRC file. This will give
you the required environment variables, so that you are able to create
resources on your project. You can find a guide
:ref:`here<command-line-interface>`  on how to source an openRC file.

Once this is done, you can follow any of the guides below, to create your
instance.

Resource cleanup using the command line
***************************************

At this point you may want to clean up the OpenStack resources that have been
created. Running the following commands should remove all networks, routers,
ports, security groups and instances. These commands will work regardless of
the method you used to create the resources as long as the names of your
resources, match the ones below. Note that the order in which you
delete resources is important.

.. warning::

 The following commands will delete all the resources you have created
 including networks and routers. Do not run these commands unless you wish to
 delete all these resources.

.. code-block:: bash

 # delete the instances
 $ openstack server delete first-instance

 # delete router interface
 $ openstack router remove port border-router $( openstack port list -f value -c ID --router border-router )

 # delete router
 $ openstack router delete border-router

 # delete network
 $ openstack network delete private-net

 # delete security group
 $ openstack security group delete first-instance-sg

 # delete ssh key
 $ openstack keypair delete first-instance-key
