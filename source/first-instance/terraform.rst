`Terraform`_ is an open source infrastructure configuration and provisioning
tool developed by `Hashicorp`_. Terraform supports the configuration of many
kinds of infrastructure, including the Catalyst Cloud. It achieves this by
using components known as `providers`_. In the case of the Catalyst Cloud, this
is the `Openstack provider`_.

.. _Terraform: https://www.terraform.io/
.. _Hashicorp: https://www.hashicorp.com/
.. _providers: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html
.. _Openstack provider: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html

For further information on using Terraform with OpenStack, see the linked
`video`_ and `blog`_ post:

Installation of Terraform is very simple. Go to the `Terraform download`_
page and choose the zip file that matches your operating system and
architecture. Unzip this file to the location where Terraform's binaries
will reside on your system. Terraform is written in `Go`_, so it has minimal
dependencies. Please refer to https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html
for detailed install instructions.

.. _Terraform download: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
.. _Go: https://golang.org/

.. code-block:: bash

 $ mkdir terraform-first-instance
 $ export TERRAFORM_DIR="$(pwd)/terraform-first-instance"
 $ cd $TERRAFORM_DIR
 $ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.12/terraform_0.12.12_linux_amd64.zip
 $ unzip unzip terraform_0.12.12_linux_amd64.zip


Before running Terraform, ensure your OpenStack credentials have been
set up. These variables are read by the `OpenStack provider`_ and will provide
Terraform with permissions to access the Catalyst Cloud APIs.

.. _OpenStack provider: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html


.. note::

 If credentials are not set up by sourcing an OpenStack RC file, a few
 required authentication arguments must be set in the OpenStack provider.
 See the Configuration Reference section of the OpenStack provider documentation.

Once Terraform had been installed and the OpenStack credentials have been set
up, a first instance may be built.

|

To create an instance using terraform, you must have a configuration file
prepared to construct your resources.

It is beyond the scope of this documentation to explain how Terraform
configuration files are written. A pre-prepared example is provided in the
`catalystcloud-orchestration`_ git repository.

For more information on writing Terraform configuration files, please consult
the `Terraform documentation`_. The configuration file used here can be used as
a template from which you can build your own configurations.

.. _catalystcloud-orchestration: https://github.com/catalyst/catalystcloud-orchestration

.. _Terraform documentation: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html

Download the configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ cd $TERRAFORM_DIR
 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catalyst-cloud/catalystcloud-orchestration/master/terraform/first-instance/first-instance-variables.tf


.. note::

  In order for the pre-prepared configuration to work, a number of changes must
  be made:

  * Edit the file and change the ``public_key`` under the ``openstack_compute_keypair_v2``
    resource. Use the actual public key string, not a path to the public key
    file.

  * Ensure that variables referred to in the file match the correct OpenStack region.
    The pre-prepared file has been set up to work with Catalyst's Porirua region.
    Pay   particular attention to ``external_gateway``, ``dns_nameservers``,
    ``image_id``,   and ``flavor_id``.


The "terraform plan" command outlines the list of operations that Terraform
will execute:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ terraform init
 $ terraform plan
 Refreshing Terraform state prior to plan...


 The Terraform execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
 Resources are shown in alphabetical order for quick scanning. Green resources
 will be created (or destroyed and then created if an existing resource
 exists), yellow resources are being changed in-place, and red resources
 will be destroyed.

 Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so when
 "apply" is called, Terraform can't guarantee this is what will execute.

 Plan: 8 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.


.. note::
  It is a good idea to review the output of this command. Check the resources that
  will be created match your intentions.

The "terraform apply" command executes the plan, creating OpenStack
resources:

 Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

 The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
 below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
 infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
 use the `terraform show` command.

 State path: terraform.tfstate


Once the terraform apply command has completed, your resources will be built
and you will be able to monitor them on the cloud.

If you wish to clean up these resources, the "terraform destroy" command will
delete any of the resources that were created using the previous command.

.. note::

  Terraform keeps track of the state of resources using a local file called
  ``terraform.tfstate``. Terraform consults this file when destroying resources
  in order to determine what to delete.

.. code-block:: bash

 $ ./terraform destroy
 Do you really want to destroy?
   Terraform will delete all your managed infrastructure.
   There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
