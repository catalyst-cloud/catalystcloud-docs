Quota management
****************

Catalyst provides the ability to manage your own project resource quotas on a
per region basis.

The **Current Quotas** block provides a view of the current quota limits that
are applied to each region in the current project. It also shows the available
**Pre-approved Quota Sizes** that can be selected and the actions that can be
taken for the quota in each region.

By clicking on the *View Size* action on the **Quota Sizes** table it is
possible to see a breakdown of the limits for each resource within that quota
band.

Finally the **Previous Quota Changes** gives a historical view of any quota
adjustments that have been made within the current project.

*Update Quota* action, the following form will be displayed

If your requested change does not fall into the - category the
**Previous Quota Changes** area will display a message showing the current
state of your request.

For pre-approved and accepted changes the display will update to show the new
*Current Quota Size* next to the appropriate region and the **Previous Quota
Changes** will

Pre-approved vs requires approval
=================================

Pre-approved changes do not require any intervention from Catalyst to be
actioned and include any changes that would be a step down in quota size or any
single step up to the next size tier.

Pre-approved sizes changes can be made as follows:

- for a decrease in quota size, no approval is necessary and this can be done
  multiple times in the current 30 day time period.
- for an increase in quota size, one pre-approved change can be made within the
  current 30 day time period. All subsequent increases, regardless of whether
  they would normally be pre-approved, will require approval from the Catalyst
  Cloud team.

.. note::

    Quota limits do not apply to object storage usage at this time.
