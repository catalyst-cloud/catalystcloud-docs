Clusters
########

This section shows an in-depth view of creating clusters and their uses.

It goes over the process of creating clusters, similar to the quickstart
section but also discusses private clusters and production ready clusters.

******************
What is a cluster?
******************

A cluster is the foundation of the Kubernetes Engine, it consists of
one or more **control plane** nodes (also referred to as **master** nodes)
and zero or more **worker** nodes.
It is made up of a collection of compute, networking, and storage resources
necessary to run any given workload. Communication between them is achieved
by way of a shared network.

**Control plane** nodes consist of a collection of services responsible for
providing the centralised scheduling, logic and management of the cluster.

The following diagram shows the relation between control plane and worker nodes:

.. figure:: _containers_assets/kubernetes-architecture-cluster.png
  :alt: Control plane and worker nodes

  *(image sourced from rancher.com)*

Some of the key services running on the control plane are:

- The interface to the cluster via the **API server**, which provides a
  RESTful API frontend to the control plane.
- Configuration and state of the cluster is managed by a distributed key value
  store, `etcd`_. It provides the single source of truth for the cluster and
  as such is the only stateful component of the control plane.
- The **scheduler** watches for pod creation events and binds them to a worker
  node. The kubelet on that node is then responsible for starting the pod
  containers.
- The **Controller Manager** maintains the state of *pods* in the cluster; creating
  and terminating them as required by *daemonsets*, *deployments*, *replicasets*
  and other resources.

.. _`etcd`: https://etcd.io

To allow for maximum redundancy, Kubernetes clusters should be deployed
with an odd number of control plane nodes e.g. 1, 3 or 5 nodes.

.. note::

  While it is possible to run a cluster with a single control plane node,
  for clusters intended to run production workloads, it is highly recommended
  to deploy your clusters in a 3 node multi-master **highly available**
  configuration.

All nodes run ``kubelet`` and the container runtime, ``containerd``.
They are responsible for running the pod workloads assigned by the scheduler using
the defined local and external resources.

*****************
Cluster Templates
*****************

The **Cluster Template** is a collection of parameters to describe how a cluster can
be constructed. These describe the machine images to start, the Kubernetes versions,
networking environment and addon installation options.

Catalyst Cloud provide public templates for our supported managed kubernetes
customers and these should provide the flexibility you need.

Template Types
==============

The naming convention used for the templates is broken down as follows:

* ``kubernetes-v1.28.9``: The version of Kubernetes that the template
  will use to create the cluster.
* ``-20240416``: The date on which the template was created.

To customise your cluster, you can specify template labels
when creating a new cluster (see :ref:`modifying_a_cluster_with_labels`).

Viewing Cluster Templates
=========================

Run the ``openstack coe cluster template list`` command to get a list
of all currently available Cluster Templates.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster template list
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | uuid                                 | name                              | tags                                                                            |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  | dafe4576-8de0-4024-a12a-1bc5197b474f | kubernetes-v1.28.9-20240416       | None                                                                            |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Default Volume Types and Sizes
==============================

By default, Kubernetes cluster nodes are provisioned using the
following volume types and disk sizes:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Volume
     - Type
     - Size
   * - Root Volume
     - b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000
     - 20GB

To change these values, you can provide additional labels to your template
(see :ref:`modifying_a_cluster_with_labels`).

For information on how volumes work, and the available storage types in a cluster,
refer to the :ref:`kubernetes-storage` documentation.

******************************
Deploying a Kubernetes cluster
******************************

This page shows how to create a cluster using the Catalyst Cloud CLI.

.. note::

  If you would like to learn how to create a cluster using the Catalyst Cloud dashboard,
  please follow the :ref:`k8s-quickstart` guide.

Creating a cluster
==================

To create a new Kubernetes cluster, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  openstack coe cluster create dev-cluster1 \
  --cluster-template kubernetes-v1.28.9-20240416 \
  --master-count 3 \
  --node-count 4

This command creates a cluster using the named template,
and 3 **control plane** (master) nodes and 4 **worker nodes**.
The name of the cluster will be ``dev-cluster1``.
These parameters can be adjusted according to your needs.

The control plane (master) node count must be a small, uneven (odd) number.
This is to ensure the ``etcd`` distributed key-value store
has an efficient and highly available quorum available
(e.g. 4 has no benefit over 3, so is not permitted).
The values ``1``, ``3``, ``5`` and ``7`` are permitted by the API.

The worker node count can be any positive number, or zero.

.. note::

  If you are looking to scale to a large number of nodes,
  please get in touch via the `Support Centre`_,
  as there are quota and performance changes to apply at cluster creation time
  for more than 50 nodes.

  Kubernetes officially `supports up to 5000 nodes`_.

  .. _`Support Centre`: https://catalystcloud.nz/support/support-centre
  .. _`supports up to 5000 nodes`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large

.. _modifying_a_cluster_with_labels:

Customising clusters using labels
=================================

It is possible to override the behaviour of a template by adding or modifying
the labels supplied by the template.

To do this, we need to provide the ``--merge-labels`` parameter along with the
``--labels`` parameter followed by the desired label or labels to modify.

To specify a single label:

.. code-block:: text

  --merge-labels --labels key=value

You can define multiple labels by separating them into comma-separated key/value pairs.
When specifying multiple labels, ensure that there is no whitespace in the list:

.. code-block:: text

  --merge-labels --labels key=value,key=value

If we want to enable the ``master_lb_floating_ip_enabled`` feature on our cluster,
we would use a cluster creation command like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  openstack coe cluster create dev-cluster1 \
  --cluster-template kubernetes-v1.28.9-20240416 \
  --merge-labels \
  --labels master_lb_floating_ip_enabled=true \
  --master-count 3 \
  --node-count 3

Private vs Public Kubernetes API access
=======================================

All provided cluster templates create a loadbalancer that is used to access
the Kubernetes API. By default this loadbalancer does not have a floating IP,
which limits access to only the subnet it is listening on.

This means the Kubernetes API must be accessed from a bastion host within
the same network.

If you wish to create a publically accessible Kubernetes API (for ``kubectl`` or
other tooling to use), you can do so by adding the following to the cluster
creation command.

.. code-block:: bash

  --labels master_lb_floating_ip_enabled=true --merge-labels

It is important to note the security implications of doing this, as your Kubernetes
API will be exposed to the internet.

.. Note::

  The ``--merge-labels`` option is required, so that default labels in the Cluster Template
  are not removed.

Checking the status of the cluster
==================================

Cluster deployment status
-------------------------

A cluster will take, on average, 10 to 15 minutes be created.

You can use the following command to check the status of the cluster:

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster list
  +--------------------------------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+
  | uuid                                 | name         | keypair | node_count | master_count | status          | health_status |
  +--------------------------------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+
  | 1fa44912-54e6-4421-a633-e2a831c38f60 | dev-cluster1 | None    |          2 |            3 | CREATE_COMPLETE | HEALTHY       |
  +--------------------------------------+--------------+---------+------------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+

Alternatively, you can check the status of the cluster on the `Clusters panel`_,
in the **Container Infra** section of the Dashboard.

.. _`Clusters panel`: https://dashboard.catalystcloud.nz/project/clusters

Please wait until the status changes to ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` to proceed.

Cluster health status
---------------------

The other field worth mentioning here is that of the health of the cluster. This
can be viewed by drilling down into the details of the cluster in the dashboard
by clicking on the link that is its name.

Alternatively, if you are working from the command line you can query the state of
a given cluster with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster show dev-cluster1 -c name -c status -c status_reason -c health_status -c health_status_reason
  +----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Field                | Value                                                                                          |
  +----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | status               | CREATE_COMPLETE                                                                                |
  | health_status        | HEALTHY                                                                                        |
  | status_reason        | None                                                                                           |
  | name                 | dev-cluster1                                                                                   |
  | health_status_reason | {'cluster': 'Ready', 'infrastructure': 'Ready', 'controlplane': 'Ready', 'nodegroup': 'Ready'} |
  +----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Here, `status` and `status_reason` show if the cluster is processing a request.

The fields `health_status` and `health_status_reason` are frequently updated and will surface errors
relating to the cluster such as quota or deletion failure reasons.

Accessing a private cluster
===========================

Once the cluster status is ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` and you have successfully
retrieved the cluster admin kubeconfig, we need to confirm that we are able to access the
cluster.

.. Note::

  The use of the bastion server is unnecessary if you created a cluster
  with a loadbalancer floating ip address.

If you did not override the default behaviour you will have created a **private
cluster**. In order to access this, you will need to create a bastion host
within the same network to allow you to reach the Kubernetes API.

.. Warning::

  When creating a bastion server on a private network that was created by Magnum,
  you will need to delete the bastion before the cluster delete can complete.

  This is best done with a configuration management tool such as Terraform.

  Failure to do this will result in a **DELETE_IN_PROGRESS** state that will not
  proceed further. More information on any deletion failure can be found in the
  field `health_status_reason`.

For the purpose of this example let's assume we deployed a bastion host with
the following characteristics:

* Name - bastion1
* Flavor - c1.c1r1
* Image - ubuntu-22.04-x86_64
* Network - attached to the Kubernetes cluster network, with floating IP.
* Security Group - bastion-ssh-access
* Security Group Rules - ingress TCP/22 from 114.110.xx.xx (public IP to allow
  traffic from)

The following commands check our setup and gather the information we need to set up our
SSH forwarding in order to reach the API endpoint.

Find the instance external public IP address

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack server show bastion1 -c addresses -f value
  {'k8s-cluster-network1': ['10.0.0.16', '103.197.62.38']}

Confirm that we have a security group applied to our instance that allows
inbound TCP connections on port 22 from our current public IP address. In this
case our security group is called bastion-ssh-access and our public IP is
114.110.xx.xx.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack server show bastion1 -c security_groups -f value
  [{'name': 'bastion-ssh-access'}, {'name': 'default'}]

  $ openstack security group rule list bastion-ssh-access
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------+-----------------------+----------------------+
  | ID                                   | IP Protocol | Ethertype | IP Range         | Port Range | Direction | Remote Security Group | Remote Address Group |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------+-----------------------+----------------------+
  | 42c1320c-98d5-4275-9c2d-xxxxxxxxxxxx | tcp         | IPv4      | 114.110.xx.xx/32 | 22:22      | ingress   | None                  | None                 |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------+-----------------------+----------------------+


Finally we need the IP address for the Kubernetes API endpoint

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster show dev-cluster1 -c api_address -f value
  https://10.0.0.5:6443


.. Note::

  Setting up SSH forwarding is optional. You could also SSH to the bastion host,
  copy the kubeconfig file, install `kubectl`, and run your cluster interactions from there.


.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Tinyproxy

      Install and configure software on the bastion host

      .. code-block:: bash

        # SSH to the bastion host floating IP address
        $ ssh ubuntu@103.197.62.38

        # Install tinyproxy
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install tinyproxy

      Configure tinyproxy to allow local connections and access to port 6443.

      .. code-block:: bash

          $ echo -e "Allow localhost\nConnectPort 6443" | sudo tee -a /etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf
          $ sudo systemctl restart tinyproxy

    .. group-tab:: SSH Forwarding

      Edit the kubeconfig file (named `config` by default), and under `clusters/0/cluster`:

      1. Set the server address to `127.0.0.1:6443`.
      2. Add `insecure-skip-tls-verify: true`.
      3. Remove `certificate-authority-data`.

      Example:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        apiVersion: v1
          clusters:
          - cluster:
              server: https://127.0.0.1:6443
              insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
            name: dev-cluster
          ...


Now you can start SSH port forwarding


.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Tinyproxy

      .. code-block:: bash

        # Start port forwarding to Tinyproxy on the bastion host.
        $ ssh -L 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 ubuntu@103.197.62.38 -N -q -f

        # Use the Tinyproxy port as an HTTPS proxy server for subsequent commands in this terminal.
        $ export HTTPS_PROXY=127.0.0.1:8888

    .. group-tab:: SSH Forwarding

      .. code-block:: bash

        # Start port forwarding, using the Kubernetes API address as the destination.
        $ ssh -L 6443:10.0.0.5:6443 ubuntu@103.197.62.38 -N -q -f


and use `kubectl` with the kubeconfig file.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/config
  $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
  NAME                                                    STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE                                             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME

You can now proceed with deploying your applications into the cluster using
`kubectl` or preferred deployment tool (such as `helm`).

******************
Resizing a cluster
******************

This section shows how to manually resize an existing cluster using the Catalyst Cloud API.

.. note::

   When using **cluster auto-scaling**, you instead set a minimum and maximum node
   count, and the auto scaler will perform the resize actions within the provided bounds.

   For more information, please refer to :ref:`auto-scaling`.

Growing or shrinking a cluster
==============================

Before we resize a cluster, we should review the current node count. This is visible in the Dashboard and CLI.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster show dev-cluster1 -c node_count
  +------------+-------+
  | Field      | Value |
  +------------+-------+
  | node_count | 2     |
  +------------+-------+

We can then set a new worker size on the cluster. This can handle scaling up or down.

.. code-block:: bash

  # Resize the number of worker nodes to 4
  $ openstack coe cluster resize dev-cluster1 4
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster1 has been accepted.

and we can see progress of the update, during which the cluster health will change to UNHEALTHY
(because the desired number of nodes temporarily differs from actual)

.. code-block:: bash

  # Showing the resize in progress
  $ openstack coe cluster show dev-cluster1 -c name -c status -c status_reason -c health_status -c health_status_reason -c node_count
  +----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Field                | Value                                                                                                                                     |

In Kubernetes we can now see the additional worker nodes and pods can schedule to them.

.. code-block:: console

  $ kubectl get nodes -o wide

***********
Node Groups
***********

Node groups are a means to create collections of resources that provide a way
to enforce scheduling requirements within a cluster.

When a cluster is created it already has two node groups, `default-master` and
`default-worker`. The number and type of nodes that you specify at creation time
become the defaults for each of these pools.

Resize commands that do not specify a node group are performed on the default-worker
nodegroup.

Using the ``openstack coe nodegroup`` commands we can add, modify or delete
custom node groups within our cluster.

These groups allow for customised configurations, such as node flavor that are applied
to all nodes within the node group.

.. Note::

  All nodes in a given node group are identical to one another, so any changes
  to the node group configuration is applied to all nodes in the node group.

Working with node groups
========================

First lets list the default node groups in our cluster named dev-cluster1.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list dev-cluster1
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                  | node_count | status          | role   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | 1d6a8545-135c-478e-a215-4712d4fbfe86 | default-master | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          1 | CREATE_COMPLETE | master |
  | b7ed8c6e-0f20-462f-8d0a-f55276ee3194 | default-worker | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          4 | UPDATE_COMPLETE | worker |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+

Creating a node group
---------------------

Now let's add a new nodegroup to our cluster with the following specifications

* Node count of 2 (if this is not provided it will default to 1)
* A node role called `test` (if this is not provided it will default to `worker`)
* A nova flavor of `c1.c4r4`.
* Node group name of `larger-pool`.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup create dev-cluster1 larger-pool --node-count 2 --role test --flavor c1.c4r4
  Request to create nodegroup 3dd6b845-e1f9-449a-a26e-f761ec5e56f3 accepted

We can check our new node group with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list dev-cluster1
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+--------------------+--------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                  | node_count | status             | role   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+--------------------+--------+
  | 1d6a8545-135c-478e-a215-4712d4fbfe86 | default-master | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          1 | CREATE_COMPLETE    | master |
  | b7ed8c6e-0f20-462f-8d0a-f55276ee3194 | default-worker | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          4 | UPDATE_COMPLETE    | worker |
  | 3dd6b845-e1f9-449a-a26e-f761ec5e56f3 | larger-pool    | c1.c4r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          2 | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | test   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+--------------------+--------+

Roles can be used to show the purpose of a node group, and multiple node groups
can be given the same role if they share a common purpose.

.. code-block:: console

  $ kubectl get nodes -L magnum.openstack.org/role -L capi.catalystcloud.nz/node-group
  NAME                                                      STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION   ROLE   NODE-GROUP
  dev-cluster1-47ctpuwqwfsi-control-plane-a8617329-hwfvz    Ready    control-plane   132m   v1.28.8

  dev-cluster1-47ctpuwqwfsi-default-worker-10b73ddb-mbtwp   Ready    <none>          86m    v1.28.8          default-worker

  dev-cluster1-47ctpuwqwfsi-larger-pool-ea1e4431-x6jgs      Ready    <none>          8m     v1.28.8          larger-pool


.. Warning::

   Currently(2024-04-15) in Kubernetes 1.28 the `ROLE` label is not being set on Kubernetes nodes.

   This is a bug and will be addressed soon.


The roles are also set on Kubernetes nodes, and can be used for scheduling with the use of a `node
selector`_.


.. _`node selector`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/

.. code-block:: yaml

  nodeSelector:
    magnum.openstack.org/role: test

or using the `node-group` name label:

.. code-block:: yaml

  nodeSelector:
    capi.catalystcloud.nz/node-group: larger-pool

Resizing a node group
---------------------

Node groups are resized with the same commands as resizing a cluster (which resizes the node group
`default-worker`), but we provide the `\-\-nodegroup` parameter to target a different node group.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster resize dev-cluster1 --nodegroup larger-pool 1
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster1 has been accepted.

and we can see the node group is resized:


.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list dev-cluster1
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                  | node_count | status          | role   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | 1d6a8545-135c-478e-a215-4712d4fbfe86 | default-master | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          1 | CREATE_COMPLETE | master |
  | b7ed8c6e-0f20-462f-8d0a-f55276ee3194 | default-worker | c1.c2r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          4 | UPDATE_COMPLETE | worker |
  | 3dd6b845-e1f9-449a-a26e-f761ec5e56f3 | larger-pool    | c1.c4r4   | flatcar-kube-1.28.8-41650 |          1 | UPDATE_COMPLETE | test   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+

Resizing the master node group
------------------------------

In Kubernetes 1.28 and above, the `default-master` node group can be resized. Before this it is not possible.

This means you can change a cluster between being a single control plane (thus, not highly available) to
having 3 or 5 control plane nodes and being highly available.

The operation is the same as resizing a worker node group:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Make our cluster highly available, with 3 control plane nodes.
  $ openstack coe cluster resize dev-cluster1 --nodegroup default-master 3
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster1 has been accepted.


Deleting a node group
---------------------

Any node group except the `default-master` and `default-worker` node groups can be
deleted, by specifying the cluster and nodegroup name or ID.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup delete dev-cluster1 larger-pool
  Request to delete nodegroup larger-pool has been accepted.

Note that though the `default-worker` node group cannot be deleted, it can be resized to `0`.
