########
Clusters
########

This section shows a more in depth view of clusters and their uses. It
goes over the process of creating clusters, similar to the quickstart section
but the difference in the following example is that it covers private clusters
and more production ready clusters.

******************
What is a cluster?
******************

A container cluster is the foundation of the Kubernetes Engine, it consists of
one or more **master node(s)** and one or more **worker node(s)**. It is made
up of a collection of compute, networking, and storage resources necessary to
run any given workloads. Communication between them is achieved by way of a
shared network.

The ``master`` server is the control plane of the cluster consisting of a
collection of services responsible for providing the centralised scheduling,
logic and management of all aspects of the cluster. While it is possible to run
a cluster with a single master which hosts all of the required services it is
more advisable, especially for production environments, to deploy your clusters
in a multi-master *highly available* configuration.

The following diagram shows the relation more clearly
*(image sourced from rancher.com)*

.. image:: _containers_assets/kubernetes-architecture-cluster.png

Some of the key services running on the master are:

- The interface to the cluster via the ``API Server``, which provides a
  RESTful API frontend to the control plane.
- Configuration and state of the cluster is managed by the ``cluster store``.
  This is based on ``etcd``, which is a distributed key-value store, and
  provides the single source of truth for the cluster and as such is the only
  stateful component within the cluster.
- The ``scheduler``

The other half of the cluster is the machines designated as ``nodes``,
previously referred to as minions. They are responsible for accepting and
running workloads assigned by the master using appropriate local and external
resources.

********************
The cluster template
********************

.. Warning::

  In an effort to make the process of getting started with Kubernetes on the
  Catalyst Cloud a much simpler process, we have decided to modify the default
  behaviour of the **development templates** we provide.

  Effective from 1 July 2020, when one of these templates is used in the
  creation of a new cluster it will, by default, provision a **floating IP** on
  the Kubernetes API endpoint meaning that the resulting cluster will be
  **publicly accessible over the internet**. It is possible to restrict access
  to a public cluster, see :ref:`limiting_access` for more details.

  If you wish to revert to the original behaviour of having a private cluster
  please launch your cluster with the following flag
  ``--floating-ip-disabled``

  As a reminder, it is considered best practice that production workloads are
  **not** deployed on a publicly accessible cluster.

A cluster template is a collection of parameters to describe how a cluster can
be constructed. Some parameters are relevant to the infrastructure of the
cluster, while others are for the particular COE. These templates work as a
blueprint for cluster creation, changing certain parameters for your cluster.

Traditionally a cloud provider may supply pre-defined templates for users and
it may also be possible, in some situations, for users to create their own
templates. Initially Catalyst Cloud will only support the use of the
pre-defined templates.

Template types
==============

The naming convention used for the templates is broken down as follows:

* **kubernetes-v1.18.2** : this is the version of kubernetes that the template
  will use to create the cluster.
* **-prod** or **-dev**: the type of environment to be created (see below).
* **-20200615**: the date on which the template was created.

The difference between the development and production templates are:

* **Production**: creates a **private** Kubernetes cluster that is intended
  for production workloads. It creates three or more master nodes and three or
  more worker nodes. The master nodes will have a loadbalancer deployed in
  front of them to provide high availability for the Kubernetes API. This
  template also deploys Prometheus and Grafana to provide cluster metrics.
* **Development**: creates a minimal, **publicly accessible** Kubernetes
  cluster with a single master and a single worker node. As the name suggests,
  it should not be used for production.

Viewing templates
=================

When running the openstack command line tools ensure that you have sourced a
valid openrc fil$ e first. For more information on this see :ref:`source-rc-file`

.. Note::

  In order to be able to create a Kubernetes cluster the user needs to ensure
  that they have been allocated the ``heat_stack_owner`` role.

Then list all of the available cluster templates.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster template list
  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | uuid                                 | name                             |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
  | bc493321-6d30-44a1-b767-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.16.9-dev-20200602  |
  | 99f51180-cdcb-4492-9163-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.16.9-prod-20200602 |
  | c06970d9-0926-4e07-8042-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.17.5-dev-20200615  |
  | 2efc83d2-e6d6-4c3a-af3b-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.17.5-prod-20200615 |
  | 228d392b-79e9-4472-8981-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.18.2-dev-20200630  |
  | 903b954d-667a-45ca-8e5c-xxxxxxxxxxxx | kubernetes-v1.18.2-prod-20200630 |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

To find more information on which template you want to use, you can view each
template via the `Cluster Templates`_ tab on our dashboard. For information
on how volumes work and storage types in a cluster refer to the
:ref:`storage<storage>` section under the kubernetes documentation.

Default volume types and sizes
------------------------------

Here we outline the defaults settings of our volumes across the different
regions of the Catalyst Cloud. Additionally, we cover where to find
information on changing these defaults using labels, and the best practices
concerning NVMe.

The following is a table that shows you the different sizes and types of
volumes that are used by default across the different regions:

+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
| Volume           | Region       |  Size  |  Type                |
+==================+==============+========+======================+
| docker volume    | Hamilton     | 20GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Porirua      | 20GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Wellington   | 20GB   | b1.standard          |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
| etcd volume      | Hamilton     | 20GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Porirua      | 20GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Wellington   | 20GB   | b1.standard          |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
| boot volume      | Hamilton     | 10GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Porirua      | 10GB   | b1.sr-r3-nvme-1000   |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+
|                  | Wellington   | 10GB   | b1.standard          |
+------------------+--------------+--------+----------------------+

You will notice that for the the volumes in the Hamilton and Porirua region,
they use an NVMe volume type but the Wellington region does not. This is
because we have not yet set up NVMe in our Wellington region, however we are
working on implementing NVMe across all our regions and hope to update this
soon.

To change these defaults you will have to change the labels for your template.
The process of which is detailed under: :ref:`modifying_a_cluster_with_labels`.

Best practices with NVMe
========================

We use NVMe for our volumes because it reduces the time it takes to pull and
start your pods, making for an overall faster cluster. In addition, using NVMe
ensures that the IOPS for the etcd volume are sufficient to a point that they
will not fail due to disk pressure, making for a more reliable and resilient
cluster overall.

.. _setting_up_kubectl:

***************************************
Interacting with the Kubernetes service
***************************************

There are two main ways, Catalyst Cloud supports, when wanting to interact with
the kubernetes service. There is the kubernetes CLI and the Container infra
section on the  Catalyst Cloud dashboard. In this section of the documentation
we will cover the command line methods in greater depth. To know more about
the dashboard approach, please see the :ref:`k8s-quickstart` section of the
documents.

Getting kubectl
===============

To deploy and manage applications on kubernetes through the command line,
we use the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`_. With this tool you can
inspect cluster resources; create, delete, and update components; and look at
your new cluster and bring up example apps. It's basically the Kubernertes
Swiss army knife.

The details for getting the latest version of kubectl can be found `here`_.

.. _`kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/
.. _`here`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#kubectl-install-1

To install these tools on Linux via the command line as a simple binary,
perform the following steps:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s \
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl

  $ chmod +x ./kubectl
  $ sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl


The basic format of a kubectl command looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]

where command, TYPE, NAME, and flags are:

- ``command``: the operation to perform
- ``TYPE``: the resource type to act on
- ``NAME``: the name of the resource in question
- ``flags``: optional flags to provide extra


Cluster access using kubeconfig files
=====================================

The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information it
needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of a cluster.
These files provide information about clusters, users, namespaces, and
authentication mechanisms.

Getting the cluster config
==========================

We use our cluster config to configure our native command line to communicate
with our cluster. To do so we have to source the config file of our
cluster using the following command.

For example: ``eval $(openstack coe cluster config <cluster-name>)``

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eval $(openstack coe cluster config k8s-cluster)

This will download the necessary certificates and create a config file within
the directory that you are running the command from. If you wish to save the
configuration to a different location you can use the
``--dir <directory_name>`` parameter to select a different destination.

.. Note::

  If you are running multiple clusters or are deleting and re-creating cluster it is necessary to
  ensure that the current ``kubectl configuration`` is referencing the right cluster. The
  following section will outline this in more detail.

Production consideration for config files
=========================================

Because the initial config file that you create contains all the certifications
for your cluster, it is recommended that for production clusters you safely
store this config file away and then create another config file that you
can share between your staff. This new file allows people access to the cluster
by authenticating with their openrc credentials. To create this new file,
you can use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eval $(openstack coe cluster config k8s-cluster --use-keystone)

Viewing the cluster
===================

It is possible to view details of the cluster with the following command. This
will return the address of the master and the services running there.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl cluster-info
  Kubernetes master is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443
  Heapster is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
  CoreDNS is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

In order to view more in depth information about the cluster simply add the
dump option to the above example. This generates output suitable for debugging
and diagnosing cluster problems. By default, it redirects everything to stdout.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl cluster-info dump

******************************
Deploying a Kubernetes cluster
******************************

If you are wanting to set up a cluster via the Catalyst Cloud dashboard, there
is a :ref:`guide<dashboard-cluster-creation>` under the quickstart section you
can follow.

Private vs Public cluster API access
====================================

Any cluster created using one of the production templates will, by default, be
created as a ``private cluster``. This means that the Kubernetes API will
**not** be accessible from the internet and access will need to be via a
bastion or jumphost server within the cloud project.

If you would prefer to create a ``publicly accessible cluster`` using one of
the production templates then simply add the following option to the cluster
creation command.

.. code-block:: bash

  --labels master_lb_floating_ip_enabled=True --merge-labels

The actual usage would look like this.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster create <Cluster name> \
  --cluster-template <Template ID> \
  --labels master_lb_floating_ip_enabled=True --merge-labels

.. Note::

  The `--merge-labels` is mandatory.

  This guide covers the steps to creating a kubernetes cluster
  from scratch. But if you wish to create a cluster on an existing
  private network then you can refer to the relevant section in
  :ref:`the private-cluster <cluster-on-existing-net>` documentation.

Creating a cluster
==================

To create a new **production** cluster run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster create k8s-cluster \
  --cluster-template kubernetes-v1.18.2-prod-20200630 \
  --keypair my-ssh-key \
  --node-count 3 \
  --master-count 3

To create a new **development** cluster run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster create k8s-cluster \
  --cluster-template kubernetes-v1.18.2-dev-20200630 \
  --keypair my-ssh-key \
  --node-count 3 \
  --master-count 1


.. _modifying_a_cluster_with_labels:

Customizing clusters using labels
=================================

It is possible to override the behaviour of a template by adding or modifying
the labels supplied by the template.

To do this, we need to provide the ``--merge-labels`` parameter along with the
``--labels`` parameter followed by the desired label or labels to modify. The
label values need to be provide as a list of key/value pairs, separated by
commas if more than one is provided.

.. Note::

  Be careful to ensure that no whitespace is included in the list, like so:
  *key=value,key=value*

So if we wanted to enable to auto_scaling feature on our cluster we would
use a cluster creation command like this:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster create k8s-cluster \
  --cluster-template kubernetes-v1.18.2-prod-20200630 \
  --labels auto_scaling_enabled=true\
  --merge-labels \
  --keypair my-ssh-key \
  --node-count 3 \
  --master-count 3


Checking the status of the cluster
==================================

Cluster deployment status
-------------------------

A cluster will take on average 10 to 15 minutes be created.

You can use the following command to check the status of the cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster list
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------+--------------+--------------------+
  | uuid                                 | name        | keypair  | node_count | master_count | status             |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------+--------------+--------------------+
  | c191470e-7540-43fe-af32-xxxxxxxxxxxx | k8s-cluster | testkey  |          1 |            1 | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+----------+------------+--------------+--------------------+

Alternatively, you can check the status of the cluster on the `Clusters panel`_
, in the ``Container Infra`` section of the Dashboard.

.. _`Clusters panel`: https://dashboard.cloud.catalyst.net.nz/project/clusters

Please wait until the status changes to ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` to proceed.

Cluster health status
---------------------

The other check worth mentioning here is that of the health of the cluster. This
can be viewed by drilling down into the details of the cluster in the dashboard
by clicking on the link that is it's name. From here

Alternatively, if you are working from the command line you can query state of
all current clusters with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster list -c name  -f value -c health_status -f value -f yaml
    health_status: UNKNOWN
    name: dev-cluster


Accessing a private cluster
===========================

Once the cluster state is ``CREATE_COMPLETE`` and you have successfully
retrieved the cluster config, we need to confirm that we are able to access the
cluster.

.. Note::

  The use of the bastion server is unnecessary if you created a public cluster
  that is directly accessible from the internet.

If you did not override the default behaviour you will have created a **private
cluster**. In order to access this you will need to create a bastion host
within your cloud project to allow you to reach the Kubernetes API.

.. Warning::

  When using a bastion server to access a private cluster you will need to
  delete the bastion before trying to delete the cluster.

  Failure to do so will leave your cluster in a **DELETE_FAILED** state that
  will require assistance from the Catalyst Cloud team to resolve.


For the purpose of this example let's assume we deployed a bastion host with
the following characteristics:

* name - bastion
* flavor - c1.c1r1
* image - ubuntu-18.04-x86_64
* network - attached to the Kubernetes cluster network
* security group - bastion-ssh-access
* security group rules - ingress TCP/22 from 114.110.xx.xx ( public IP to allow
  traffic from)

The following commands are to check our setup and gather the information we
need to set up our SSH forward in order to reach the API endpoint.

Find the instance's external public IP address

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack server show bastion -c addresses -f value
  private=10.0.0.16, 103.197.62.38

Confirm that we have a security group applied to our instance that allows
inbound TCP connections on port 22 from our current public IP address. In this
case our security group is called bastion-ssh-access and out public IP is
114.110.xx.xx.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack server show bastion -c security_groups -f value
  name='bastion-ssh-access'
  name='default'

  $ openstack security group rule list bastion-ssh-access
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------------------+
  | ID                                   | IP Protocol | Ethertype | IP Range         | Port Range | Remote Security Group |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------------------+
  | 42c1320c-98d5-4275-9c2d-xxxxxxxxxxxx | tcp         | IPv4      | 114.110.xx.xx/32 | 22:22      | None                  |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+-----------+------------------+------------+-----------------------+

Finally we need the IP address for the Kubernetes API endpoint

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack coe cluster show k8s-prod -c api_address -f value
  https://10.0.0.5:6443

We will make use of SSH's port forwarding ability in order to allow us to
connect from our local machine's environment. To do this run the following
command in your shell.

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh -f -L 6443:10.0.0.5:6443 ubuntu@103.197.62.38 -N

* -f fork the process in background
* -N do not execute any commands
* -L specifies what connections are given to the localhost. In this example we use the
   ``port:host:hostport`` to bind 6443 on localhost to 6443 on the API endpoint at 10.0.0.5
* The **ubuntu@103.197.62.38** is the credentials for SSH to log into the bastion host.

.. Note::

  Setting up the SSH forwarding is optional. You can choose to deploy a cloud
  instance on the Kubernetes cluster network with appropriate remote access
  and SSH on it and run all of your cluster interactions from there.

As a quick test we can run the following curl command to check that we get a
response from the API server.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ curl https://localhost:6443 --insecure
  {
    "kind": "Status",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {

    },
    "status": "Failure",
    "message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/\"",
    "reason": "Forbidden",
    "details": {

    },
    "code": 403
  }

If the curl request returned a JSON response similar to that shown above you
can run the following command to confirm that Kubernetes is working as
expected.

First, if you are running a private cluster and connecting over the SSH tunnel
you will need to edit the kubeconfig file you retrieved earlier and make the
following change.

Find the ``server`` entry that points to the Kubernetes API.

.. code-block:: bash

  server: https://10.0.0.5:6443

Change it so that it points to the localhost address instead.

.. code-block:: bash

  server: https://127.0.0.1:6443

Then run kubectl to confirm that the cluster responds correctly.

.. Note::

    If you have not yet set up the Kubernetes command line tools see :ref:`setting_up_kubectl` for details.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl cluster-info
  Kubernetes master is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443
  Heapster is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
  CoreDNS is running at https://103.254.156.157:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

You can now proceed with deploying your applications into the cluster using
kubectl or whatever your preferred mechanism may be.

Accessing the Kubernetes dashboard
**********************************

*******************************
Managing cluster configurations
*******************************

When working with multiple clusters or a cluster that has been torn down and
recreated it is necessary to ensure that you have the correct ``cluster
context`` loaded in order for kubectl to interact with the intended cluster.

In order to see the current configuration and context that ``kubectl`` is
using, run the following.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl config view
  apiVersion: v1
  clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority: /home/testuser/tmp/ca.pem
      server: https://202.49.241.204:6443
    name: k8s-m1-n1
  contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: k8s-m1-n1
      user: admin
    name: default
  current-context: default
  kind: Config
  preferences: {}
  users:
  - name: admin
    user:
      client-certificate: /home/testuser/tmp/cert.pem
      client-key: /home/testuser/tmp/key.pem

  $ kubectl config current-context
  default

This shows us the details of the current configuration file that kubectl is
referencing and also the specific cluster context within that, in this case
``default``. There is also an environment variable called ``$KUBECONFIG`` that
stores the path or paths to the various configurations that are available.

If we had run the command to retrieve the cluster configuration from a
directory called tmp within our home directory then the output would look
like this.

.. code-block:: bash

  echo $KUBECONFIG
  /home/testuser/tmp/config

If there was a second cluster that we wished to also be able to work with then
we need to retrieve the configuration and store it to a local directory.

.. Note::

  At the current time it is not possible to store multiple cluster
  configurations within the same directory. There is a change coming in a future
  release that will make this possible using a converged configuration file.

If you run ``eval $(openstack coe cluster config <cluster-name>)`` within a
directory that already contains the configuration for a cluster it will fail.
If this is intentional, as in the case of upgrading a cluster that has been
rebuilt, then this is possible by adding the ``--force`` flag, like this.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eval $(openstack coe cluster config --force k8s-cluster )

If you are wanting to download the configuration for another cluster then we
can use the ``-dir`` flag and pass in the location for the configuration to be
saved. Here we will save our new configuration into a directory called
``.kube/`` under the users home directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ eval $(openstack coe cluster config --dir ~/.kube/ k8s-cluster-2)

If we now check the current config we will see that it also says ``default``,
this is because the naming convention used in the creation of the local config
automatically is loaded with **default** as its value.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl config current-context
  default

If we view the actual config however we can see that this is indeed a different
file to the one we view previously.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl config view
  apiVersion: v1
  clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority: /home/testuser/.kube/ca.pem
      server: https://202.49.240.103:6443
    name: k8s-cluster-2
  contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: k8s-cluster-2
      user: admin
    name: default
  current-context: default
  kind: Config
  preferences: {}
  users:
  - name: admin
    user:
      client-certificate: /home/testuser/.kube/cert.pem
      client-key: /home/testuser/.kube/key.pem

To make things more useful we can change and confirm the new name of the
context in the following manner.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kubectl config rename-context default test
  $ kubectl config current-context
  test

The final step needed to give us access to both of our clusters is to update
the ``$KUBECONFIG`` environment variable so that it knows about both and allows
us to see them in a single view.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export KUBECONFIG=~/tmp/config:~/.kube/config
  $ kubectl config get-contexts
  CURRENT   NAME      CLUSTER        AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
            default   k8s-cluster    admin
  *         test      k8s-cluster-2  admin


Now we can simply switch between the various contexts available to us in the
following manner.

.. code-block:: bash

  kubectl config use-context default

******************
Resizing a cluster
******************

As the default behaviour for the Catalyst Cloud cluster templates is to have
**cluster auto-scaling** disabled by default, it is useful to be aware that it
is possible to manually modify the number of worker nodes within an existing
cluster.


Growing or shrinking a cluster
==============================

This is the most obvious use case and relates to adding or removing worker nodes
from a cluster in order to keep available resources in line with demand on the
cluster.

Using the following command we can take a look at the nodes currently assigned
to the cluster and can see that we have a single master and three workers.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack server list --name dev-cluster
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | ID                                   | Name                              | Status | Networks                               | Image | Flavor  |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+

  | 83a75000-178c-4d5e-9e2f-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-1   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.5                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 94b2603e-cb0f-4292-8f3d-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-0   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.7                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 63f5206c-2105-489c-8fd8-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-master-0 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.4                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+

Let's assume that due to current demand we only require 2 worker nodes in our
cluster.  If we issue the following command, the cluster will scale down the
worker node count from three to two.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster resize dev-cluster 2
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster has been accepted.

If we check the cluster state we can see it is now showing
``UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS``.


.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster list
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+------------+------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------+
  | uuid                                 | name        | keypair    | node_count | master_count | status             | health_status |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+------------+------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------+
  | d9d767eb-d94a-4a0b-baad-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster | glxxxxxxes |          4 |            1 | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | UNKNOWN       |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+------------+------------+--------------+--------------------+---------------+

Once this changes to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE`` we can recheck the servers belonging to
our cluster and confirm that we now only have two worker nodes present.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack server list --name dev-cluster
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | ID                                   | Name                              | Status | Networks                               | Image | Flavor  |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | 73222f7c-9219-4b64-809a-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-2   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.6                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 83a75000-178c-4d5e-9e2f-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-1   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.5                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 63f5206c-2105-489c-8fd8-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-master-0 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.4                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+

The case for increasing the number of worker nodes works in exactly the same
manner, with the resize count simply being the number of nodes that you wish to
increase the count to.

For example if we now wanted to increase from two workers
up to four we would issue the following command.


.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster resize dev-cluster 4
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster has been accepted.

Repairing a worker node
=======================

While the default behaviour of the Catalyst Cloud cluster templates has the
cluster auto-heal functionality enabled by default it is useful to know that if
you had disabled this for some reason you can still force a rebuild of a
worker node using the cluster resize command.

If we take a look at the nodes in our cluster

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack server list --name dev-cluster
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | ID                                   | Name                              | Status | Networks                               | Image | Flavor  |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | 73222f7c-9219-4b64-809a-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-2   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.6                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 83a75000-178c-4d5e-9e2f-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-1   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.5                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 94b2603e-cb0f-4292-8f3d-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-0   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.7                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 63f5206c-2105-489c-8fd8-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-master-0 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.4                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+

Let's assume for the purpose of this example, assume that
**dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-0** is unhealthy. We can target this specific
node via it's UUID and force a resize with the same number of cluster nodes.
This will result in that node being removed and recreated.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster resize --nodes-to-remove 94b2603e-cb0f-4292-8f3d-xxxxxxxxxxxx dev-cluster 3
  Request to resize cluster dev-cluster has been accepted.

The result is that we still have 3 worker nodes, but the problematic node-0 has
been replaced by node-3.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack server list --name dev-cluster
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | ID                                   | Name                              | Status | Networks                               | Image | Flavor  |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+
  | 82624fd4-6ff9-4fa7-9be7-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-3   | BUILD  |                                        |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 73222f7c-9219-4b64-809a-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-2   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.6                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 83a75000-178c-4d5e-9e2f-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-node-1   | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.5                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  | 63f5206c-2105-489c-8fd8-xxxxxxxxxxxx | dev-cluster-ipzptyqqnoje-master-0 | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.4                       |       | c1.c2r2 |
  +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------------+-------+---------+


***********
Node Groups
***********

Node groups, also known as node pools, are a means to create collections of
resources that provide a way to enforce scheduling requirements within a
cluster. This functionality is only supported for Kubernetes clusters.

When a cluster is created it already has two node groups, default-master and
default-worker, the number and type of nodes that you specify at creation time
become the defaults for each of these pools.

Using the ``openstack coe nodegroup`` command we can subsequently add, modify
or delete additional custom node groups within our cluster. These groups allow
for customised configurations such as, node image, node storage type and base
node resources, to be applied to the nodes in that group.

.. Note::

  All nodes in a given node group are identical to one another, so any changes
  to the node configuration will be applied to all nodes in the node group.

Working with node groups
========================

First lets list the default nodes on our cluster named kube-test.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list kube-test
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                             | node_count | status          | role   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | ac36585b-a031-4f4a-84f1-xxxxxxxxxxxx | default-master | c1.c2r4   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          3 | CREATE_COMPLETE | master |
  | 7eebd682-5bc7-4025-bb74-xxxxxxxxxxxx | default-worker | c1.c4r8   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          2 | CREATE_COMPLETE | worker |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+

Creating a node group
---------------------

Now let's add a new nodegroup to our cluster. While it is possible to create a
new nodegroup by providing the ClusterID and a node group name it is also
possible to provide some extra parameters at the time of creation.

With this in mind we will create a new nodegroup with the following

* node count of two (if this is not provided it will default to one)
* a node role called **test** (if this is not provided it will default to worker)

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup create kube-test --node-count 2 --role test
  Request to create nodegroup cf483236-f74d-4bac-bde9-xxxxxxxxxxxx accepted

We can check our new node group with the following command.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list kube-test
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                             | node_count | status          | role   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+
  | ac36585b-a031-4f4a-84f1-xxxxxxxxxxxx | default-master | c1.c2r4   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          3 | UPDATE_COMPLETE | master |
  | 7eebd682-5bc7-4025-bb74-xxxxxxxxxxxx | default-worker | c1.c4r8   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          9 | UPDATE_COMPLETE | worker |
  | cf483236-f74d-4bac-bde9-xxxxxxxxxxxx | test-nodegroup | c1.c4r8   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          2 | CREATE_COMPLETE | test   |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+--------+

It is also possible to use the role as a filter to limit output.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup list kube-test --role test
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+------+
  | uuid                                 | name           | flavor_id | image_id                             | node_count | status          | role |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+------+
  | cf483236-f74d-4bac-bde9-xxxxxxxxxxxx | test-nodegroup | c1.c4r8   | 5de1a6a3-3ee1-4593-8c88-xxxxxxxxxxxx |          2 | CREATE_COMPLETE | test |
  +--------------------------------------+----------------+-----------+--------------------------------------+------------+-----------------+------+

Roles can be used to show the purpose of a node group, and multiple node groups
can be given the same role if they share a common purpose.

.. code-block:: console

  kubectl get nodes -L magnum.openstack.org/role
  NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION   ROLE
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-master-0           Ready    master   15d     v1.18.2   master
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-master-1           Ready    master   15d     v1.18.2   master
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-master-2           Ready    master   15d     v1.18.2   master
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-node-0             Ready    <none>   15d     v1.18.2   worker
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-node-1             Ready    <none>   15d     v1.18.2   worker
  prod-1-18-2-42ocujctdnyv-node-2             Ready    <none>   9m47s   v1.18.2   worker
  prod-1-18-2-test-node-lr3p5s7iios6-node-0   Ready    <none>   2m32s   v1.18.2   test
  prod-1-18-2-test-node-lr3p5s7iios6-node-1   Ready    <none>   2m31s   v1.18.2   test

These roles can then be be used for scheduling through the use of a node
selector as shown here.

.. code-block:: yaml

  nodeSelector:
    magnum.openstack.org/role: test


Resizing a node group
---------------------

Resizing a node group is done with the same API as resizing a cluster, but
the **--nodegroup** parameter must be used.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe cluster resize kube-test --nodegroup test-nodegroup 1
  Request to resize cluster kube-test has been accepted.

It is also possible to use the **--nodes-to-remove** parameter may be used to
remove specific nodes when decreasing the size of a node group.

Deleting a node group
---------------------

Any node group except the default master and worker node groups can be
deleted, by specifying the cluster and nodegroup name or ID.

.. code-block:: console

  $ openstack coe nodegroup delete kube-test test-nodegroup
