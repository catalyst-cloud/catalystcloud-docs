The network service allows you to create your own private networks, sub-nets,
routers, security groups and site-to-site VPNs. As most of the other
services on the Catalyst Cloud rely on a network to function, we strive to
provide a networking service that is easy to implement, easy to understand
and highly secure. In the following sections, we discuss the different ways in
which you can interact with the networking service and the benefits each
provides to the networking service as a whole.
