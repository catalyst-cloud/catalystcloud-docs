Public networks
***************

Catalyst Cloud operates a public network in each region. These public networks
provide you with connectivity to the Internet and allow you to allocate
floating IPs (public IPs that can be associated to your compute instances) from
a pool managed by Catalyst Cloud.

Our public networks are listed on the table below:

+----------+--------------------------------------+
|  Region  | ID                                   |
