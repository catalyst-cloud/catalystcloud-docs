Data must be stored in a container (also referred to as a bucket) so we need
to create at least one container prior to uploading data. To create a new
container, navigate to the "Containers" section and click "Create Container".

Provide a name for the container and select the appropriate access level and
click "Create".

.. note::

  Setting "Public" level access on a container means that anyone
  with the container's URL can access the content of that container.

You should now see the newly created container. As this is a new container, it
currently does not contain any data. Click on "Upload Object" to add some
content.

In the Containers view the Object Count has gone up to one and the size of
the container is now 314 Bytes.
