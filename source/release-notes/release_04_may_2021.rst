Database as a service hits open beta! Continued development from our team at
Catalyst Cloud has delivered features that we've deemed worthy of progression
to beta.

Database as a service (Trove)
****************************************

Database service Beta
=====================

We are moving our database as a service offering to open beta. This allows all
customers the ability to create their own managed database resources on the
Catalyst Cloud. Customers who participated in the technical preview of the
service will begin being charged for database resources they consume from open
beta onwards.

During beta we have two datastore images available: PostgreSQL and MySQL.
Documentation related to these services is available in the :ref:`database_page`
section.

Database dashboard functionality
================================

Moving to an Open beta also introduces to our cloud a web dashboard for
managing database resources. During this period, our team will continue to add
functionality and resolve identified issues. Once we are confident all known
issues with the service are resolved, we will progress out of beta.

We hope you enjoy this new functionality!
