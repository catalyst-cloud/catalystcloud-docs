  are:

  - kubernetes-v1.18.2-dev-20200630

* Support of the templates for Kubernetes v1.15.11 will be deprecated.
* Added support for the sha256 digest check for k8s hyperkube image.
* The behaviour of the Kubernetes **development templates** has changed to make
  all new clusters created with them **publicly accessible over the internet**
  by default.
* Added support to allow for cluster labels to be over-ridden at creation time
  by means of merging changes rather than having to provide the entire label
  list.
* Enable visibility of the cluster health status for private clusters.
* Provide a means to limit access to the Kubernetes API through the use of the
  the ``master_lb_allowed_cidrs`` label.
