Major upgrade to the Compute (Nova) service.

==================
Crash dump request
==================

The instance action ``trigger_crash_dump`` has been added to the REST API and
will be available via the command line. This allows users to force
instances to perform a crash dump for debugging purposes by requesting a
non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Operating systems configured to respond to the
NMI will perform a core dump and reboot.

===============================
Custom descriptions for servers
===============================

A custom description attribute can be added when creating, rebuilding or
updating a server instance. In order to use this new feature, relevant request
headers must specify at least microversion 2.19.

==============================
Delete server events
==============================

Events can now be retrieved for instances that have been deleted, which can be
useful when performing an audit. It's important to note that this only applies
to instances deleted since this release.

This means that GET requests for server events, sent to the correct endpoint
for the v2.1 API will still return an output even for instances that have been
deleted as long as you are able to specify the UUID of said instance.

===========================
EC2 Compute API Port Change
===========================

The EC2 compute API has now been configured to listen on port 8788 instead of
port 8773. The updated API URLs can be found on the API page of the dashboard
and :ref:`in this section<apis>` of the documentation.

Any Client software making use of the EC2 API for compute operations will need
to be configured to use the new URL and port.

Please note note that this change does not affect EC2 credentials or object
storage; these continue to operate as before.

===========================
New host affinity policies
===========================

Two new affinity policies are available this release; soft-affinity and
soft-anti-affinity. These 'soft' policies are respectively similar to the
existing affinity and anti-affinity policies, but differ from the existing
policies in that they apply the (anti-)affinity rule as a preference rather
than a strict rule. This difference is outlined in the table below:

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Policy        | Description                                            |
+===============+========================================================+
| affinity      | Run all servers on the same hypervisor host.           |
|               | If this is not possible, do not start the servers that |
|               | are unable to meet this policy.                        |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| anti-affinity | Run all servers on separate hypervisor hosts. If this  |
|               | is not possible, do not start the servers that are     |
|               | unable to meet this policy.                            |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| soft-affinity | Attempt to run all servers on the same hypervisor      |
|               | host. If this is not possible, start the remaining     |
|               | servers on as few other hypervisor hosts as possible.  |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+


In order to use this new feature, relevant request headers must specify at
least microversion 2.15.

======================================
New Attributes in Server Group Request
======================================

The attributes ``project-id`` and ``user-id`` are now included in the return
data of ``os-server-groups`` API requests. In order to use this new feature,
relevant request headers must specify at least microversion 2.13.

==========================
Compute API notice
==========================

Some of the new features described above are only accessible from the v2.1
compute API. This is accessible from the same URL and port as the v2 API but
requires that the path is changed from ``/v2/`` to ``/v2.1/``. So for example the
compute API v2.1 for the Porirua region is
``https://api.nz-por-1.catalystcloud.io:8774/v2.1/``.

A list of API URLs can be found
:ref:`in the API section<apis>` of this documentation and on the `API page of the
dashboard <https://dashboard.catalystcloud.nz/project/api_access/>`_.

For backwards compatibility reasons the service catalogue still publishes
the v2 API, so in order to use the v2.1 API you will currently need to manually
ove-ride this URL in the configuration of your cloud orchestration software.

Please note that the compute v2 API endpoint is being deprecated and will be
retired after the next major compute upgrade.


===================
Deprecation Notices
===================

.. _deprecate-compute-v2:

--------------
Compute API v2
--------------

The compute v2 API endpoint is being deprecated and will be retired after the next major compute upgrade.

---------------
EC2 Compute API
---------------

The EC2 compute API on port 8773 is no longer available. This service now
listens on port 8788.
