Major upgrade to the Compute (Nova) service. The changes include a new API
version as well as several new features to the service.

==========================
Compute API version change
==========================

In this release the compute v2 API has been changed from v2 to v2.1. This
therefore changes the API URL path from /v2 to /v2.1. So for example the
compute v2 API for the Porirua region has now been changed to
https://api.nz-por-1.catalystcloud.io:8774/v2.1.
The updated API URLs can be found
:ref:`in this section<apis>` of the documentation or on the API page of the
dashboard.

Most client applications should obtain the correct URL automatically from the
service catalogue and therefore do not require additional configuration.
However, any specially configured applications or scripts that use the
v2 API that you have written yourself should be updated to use the v2.1 API
instead.

Additionally, The v2.1 API is required for some of the new compute features and
will be a prerequisite for additional features in future. It also retains full
backwards-compatibility with the old v2 API, so older software that only
supports API v2 can be configured to use the v2.1 API without loss of
functionality.

The v2 API endpoint will continue to function as-is until the next compute
service upgrade after which it will be retired completely.

==================
Crash dump request
==================

The instance action ``trigger_crash_dump`` has been added to the REST API and
will be available via the command line. This allows users to force
instances to perform a crash dump for debugging purposes by requesting a
non-maskable interrupt (NMI). Operating systems configured to respond to the
NMI will perform a core dump and reboot.

===============================
Custom descriptions for servers
===============================

A custom description attribute can be added when creating, rebuilding or
updating a server instance. In order to use this new feature, relevant request
headers must specify at least microversion 2.19.

==============================
Delete server events
==============================

Events can now be retrieved for instances that have been deleted, which can be
useful when performing an audit. It's important to note that this only applies
to instances deleted since this release.

This means that GET requests for server events, sent to the correct endpoint
for the v2.1 API will still return an output even for instances that have been
deleted as long as you are able to specify the UUID of said instance.

===========================
EC2 Compute API Port Change
===========================

The EC2 compute API has now been configured to listen on port 8788 instead of
port 8773. The updated API URLs can be found on the API page of the dashboard
and :ref:`in this section<apis>` of the documentation.

Any Client software making use of the EC2 API for compute operations will need
to be configured to use the new URL and port.

Please note note that this change does not affect EC2 credentials or object
storage; these continue to operate as before.

===========================
New host affinity policies
===========================

Two new affinity policies are available this release; soft-affinity and
soft-anti-affinity. These 'soft' policies are respectively similar to the
existing affinity and anti-affinity policies, but differ from the existing
policies in that they apply the (anti-)affinity rule as a preference rather
than a strict rule. This difference is outlined in the table below:

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Policy        | Description                                            |
+===============+========================================================+
| affinity      | Run all servers on the same hypervisor host.           |
|               | If this is not possible, do not start the servers that |
|               | are unable to meet this policy.                        |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| anti-affinity | Run all servers on separate hypervisor hosts. If this  |
|               | is not possible, do not start the servers that are     |
|               | unable to meet this policy.                            |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| soft-affinity | Attempt to run all servers on the same hypervisor      |
|               | host. If this is not possible, start the remaining     |
|               | servers on as few other hypervisor hosts as possible.  |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+


In order to use this new feature, relevant request headers must specify at
least microversion 2.15.

======================================
New Attributes in Server Group Request
======================================

The attributes ``project-id`` and ``user-id`` are now included in the return
data of ``os-server-groups`` API requests. In order to use this new feature,
relevant request headers must specify at least microversion 2.13.

===================
Deprecation Notices
===================

--------------
Compute API v2
--------------

The compute v2 API endpoint has been replaced with API v2.1. The v2 endpoint
will continue to function as-is until the next compute upgrade when it will be
retired completely.

---------------
EC2 Compute API
---------------

The EC2 compute API on port 8773 is no longer available. This service now
listens on port 8788.
