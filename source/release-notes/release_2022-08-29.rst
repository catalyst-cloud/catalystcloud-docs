Minor upgrade to the Dashboard and to the Kubernetes service.

*******************

Fixed usage graph
=================

An error with the usage graph on the dashboard has been resolved. You should
now be able to see your current use and costs using the graph without an issue.

- horizon!24 (merged) - Feature to filter images based on horizon_visibility
  image property to enable selectively hiding images from the dashboard.
- horizon!29 (merged) - Buxfig to disable microversion checks for
  auto_allocated_network and multiattach, resolving a description handling bug
  with Nova Mitaka.

Change to sign up credit
========================

We have reduced the length that the initial sign up credit is valid for on
our cloud. It has been reduced from 1 year (365 days) to 3 months (90 days).
