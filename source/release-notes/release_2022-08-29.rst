Minor upgrade to the Dashboard and to the Kubernetes service.

*******************
Dashboard (Horizon)
*******************

Bug fixes
=========

With this upgrade we have been able to resolve a number of bugs that our
dashboard had been experiencing. These bugs include:

- An error with the usage graph on the dashboard. You should
  now be able to see your current usage and costs using the graph without an
  issue.
- An error message that displayed when making changes to instances using
  the dashboard. Error messages relating to microversion checks on
  auto_allocated_networks should now provide more precise information

Ease of use changes
===================

Also included in this patch was a change to how we display images that are
available from the dashboard. When selecting an image for an instance you
should now see a more optimally filtered list of images to choose from,
prioritizing images that are still maintained and up to date.

************************
Container Infra (Magnum)
************************

New template types available
============================

Changes to the Kubernetes service have been made that include new template
versions for the service. The new fully supported versions are 1.19, 1.20, and
1.21.

Additionally, creating clusters of version 1.22 is now available, however
migrating existing clusters to this new version type will require some
manual help from our engineering team. If you wish to upgrade to the newest
version, please create a support ticket and let us know, we will arrange a time
that works to preform this upgrade work.

***********************
Miscellaneous
***********************

Change to sign up credit
========================

We have reduced the length that the initial sign up credit is valid for on
our cloud. It has been reduced from 1 year (365 days) to 3 months (90 days).
