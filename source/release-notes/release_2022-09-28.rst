The changes for this release include an upgrade of both the Keystone
(Authentication) and Swift (object storage) services, as well as a minor change
to rate limiting and Neutron being added to the Audit log service.

*********************************
Authentication upgrade (Keystone)
*********************************

With the upgrade to the keystone service completed we are now focusing on
implementing new features that are possible with the new version. The first of
which is that the records for user authentication are now encrypted at rest.
Meaning should a malicious actor gain access to the records they would be
unreadable.

Other new features will be brought through as we are able to implement them and
these will be detailed in future release notes.

******************************
Object storage upgrade (Swift)
******************************

With this upgrade to the swift service, several bugs that were present in
previous versions have been fixed. Namely, an edge case S3 signature
computation mis-match was fixed and should no longer cause problems with s3
integration. As well as a fix to how segmented data is governed by a
containers policy.

***************************
Neutron added to audit logs
***************************

This release sees the addition of the Neutron (Network) data included into the
audit log service. This means that the logs for your networking resources can
also be managed using the audit log service that we provide.

*********************
Change to rate limits
*********************

Additionally, we have made a change to the rate limits that we have on the
cloud. This release we have doubled the maximum API rate limit.
