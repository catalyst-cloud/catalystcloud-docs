The changes for this release include an upgrade to both the Keystone
(Authentication) and Swift (Object Storage) services. Also included in this
release, is a minor change to rate limiting as well as Neutron being added to
the Audit log service.

*********************************
Authentication upgrade (Keystone)
*********************************

We have recently completed an upgrade to the underlying Keystone service that
is responsible for the management of authentication details on Catalyst Cloud.
With this upgrade completed we can begin to add new features for this service
in future releases. These features will be mentioned in more detail in
future release notes.

******************************
Object Storage upgrade (Swift)
******************************

With this upgrade to the Swift service, several bugs that were present in
previous versions have been fixed. Specifically: A fix was made to the way
object storage applied replication policies to stored data. No data was at
risk while this fault was occurring.

***************************
Neutron added to audit logs
***************************

This release sees the addition of Neutron (Network) configuration data being
included in the audit log service. This means you can now include network
configuration in your security auditing solutions.

*********************
Change to rate limits
*********************

Finally, we have made a change to the rate limits that we have on the
cloud. This release we have doubled the maximum API rate limit.
