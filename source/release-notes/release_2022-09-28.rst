The changes for this release include an upgrade to both the Keystone
(Authentication) and Swift (object storage) services. Also included is a minor
change to rate limiting as well as Neutron being added to the Audit log
service.

*********************************
Authentication upgrade (Keystone)
*********************************

We have recently completed an upgrade to the underlying keystone service that
is responsible for the management of authentication details on Catalyst Cloud.
With this upgrade completed we can begin to add new features for this service
in future releases. These features will be mentioned in more detail in
future release notes.

******************************
Object storage upgrade (Swift)
******************************

With this upgrade to the swift service, several bugs that were present in
previous versions have been fixed. Namely, an edge case S3 signature
computation mis-match was fixed and should no longer cause problems with s3
integration. Another fix was made to how segmented data is governed by a
containers policy; it should now be consistent across all segmented pieces of
data.

***************************
Neutron added to audit logs
***************************

This release sees the addition of Neutron (Network) data beinig included in the
audit log service. This means that the logs for your networking resources can
also be managed using the audit log service that we provide.

*********************
Change to rate limits
*********************

Finally, we have made a change to the rate limits that we have on the
cloud. This release we have doubled the maximum API rate limit.
