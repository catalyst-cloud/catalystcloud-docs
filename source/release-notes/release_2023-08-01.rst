Container Infra (Magnum)

Our Magnum service has changed the affinity policy for all newly built clusters.

Both Control Plane and Worker nodes now use `soft-anti-affinity`.
This provides a best-effort spread of nodes across hypervisors and allows for more worker nodes than hypervisors available.

For more information on server affinity, see `Using server affinity for HA`_.
