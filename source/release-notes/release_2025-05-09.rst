Magnum Cluster Templates
------------------------

With the release of 1.33 for Catalyst Cloud Kubernetes Service, clusters
built on 1.30 is scheduled to transition to unsupported on 28th Jun 2025 and these templates will be hidden from the Dashboard after this date.

If you have clusters of version 1.30 and older, you should consider upgrading these soon.

Building clusters with a hidden cluster template remains possible through the CLI and API.
This supports the case where you need an identical version of an older cluster created.

See :ref:`supported-kubernetes-versions` for more information, and upgrade your
1.30 clusters.
