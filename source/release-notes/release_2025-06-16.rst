==================================
Catalyst Cloud Kubernetes Service
==================================

We have released an upgrade for the API service of CCKS, with this comes several useful changes:

* The autoscaling feature now permits updates to the `min_node_count` and `max_node_count` fields
  on Node Group resources. See :ref:`autoscaling-modifying-minmax` for more information and examples.
* Cluster ``status_reason`` now contains an additional property ``addons`` which indicates the progress of installation of manifests into your cluster. This can be useful for identifying issues that may be preventing installation, such as webhook configuration.
* Clusters being upgraded will no longer transition to ``UPDATE_COMPLETE`` before all nodes have been replaced.

To get started using our CNCF Certified Kubernetes service, follow the
:ref:`Kubernetes Quick-Start Guide<k8s-quickstart>`.
