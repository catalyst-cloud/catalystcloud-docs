This release contains two major upgrades with a number of useful new features
and capabilities. The details of these are described below.

==============
C3-GPU compute
==============

This release introduces the new `C3-GPU compute
<https://catalystcloud.nz/services/iaas/compute/compute-c3-gpu/>`_ service,
providing instances with dedicated NVIDIA L40S GPUs. Using dedicated GPUs means
that any compatible driver release and CUDA toolkit version can be installed,
unlike C2-GPU which is currently limited to driver release 535 and CUDA 12.2.

C3 compute classes also offer dedicated CPU cores to workloads to ensure fast
and predictable performance.

================
CCKS GPU Support
================

GPU worker support is now available in CCKS! For more information please refer
to the :doc:`GPU documentation </kubernetes/gpu-acceleration>`.

Please note that this is subject to availability of GPU capacity.
