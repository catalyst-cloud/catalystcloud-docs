This release introduces two new public compute offerings to the Porirua region (nz-por-1). These services are not
currently available in the Hamilton region (nz-hlz-1).

===============
C1A-GPU Compute
===============

C1A-GPU is a new compute type featuring `dedicated NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs and AMD EPYC "Milan" CPUs
<https://catalystcloud.nz/services/iaas/compute/compute-c1a-gpu/>`__. This is an excellent value offering for
accessing GPU acceleration at a lower cost compared to C3-GPU. It is also supported by :doc:`Kubernetes worker
nodes </kubernetes/gpu-acceleration>`.

C1A-GPU compute is currently offered as a Beta service and is subject to our Beta conditions.

==========
C3 Compute
==========

C3 is our latest general compute offering featuring `dedicated performance with modern Intel Xeon 'Sapphire
Rapids' series processors <https://catalystcloud.nz/services/iaas/compute/compute-c3/>`__ . To utilise C3 simply select
a ``c3`` flavor when :doc:`deploying new server instances </compute/launch-compute-instance>`. Existing servers can
also be :ref:`resized <resize-server>`, but note that the virtual hardware and network interface topology within the
server may change to accomodate for the more modern capabilities of C3 compute.
