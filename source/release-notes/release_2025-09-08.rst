This release introduces new C3 compute capability to the Hamilton region (nz-hlz-1), completing availability in all
of our compute regions.

=============================
C3 compute in nz-hlz-1 region
=============================

`C3 general compute <https://catalystcloud.nz/services/iaas/compute/compute-c3/>`__ is now available in our Hamilton
region (nz-hlz-1). C3 is our latest compute offering featuring dedicated performance with modern Intel Xeon 'Sapphire
Rapids' series processors. To utilise C3 simply select a ``c3`` flavor when :doc:`deploying new server instances
</compute/launch-compute-instance>`. Existing servers can also be :ref:`resized <resize-server>`, but note that the
virtual hardware and network interface topology within the server may change to accomodate for the more modern
capabilities of C3 compute.
