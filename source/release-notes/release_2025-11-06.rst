Magnum Cluster Templates
------------------------

With the release of 1.34 for Catalyst Cloud Kubernetes Service, clusters
running 1.31 are scheduled to transition to unsupported on 7th November 2025
and these templates will be hidden from the Dashboard after this date.

Due to the Kubernetes project cancelling the October patch release, it is
expected a final patch release for 1.31 will be in November. If this occurs
we will list both templates as the final patch verison on our CCKS versions
page for either to be referenced.

Building clusters with a hidden cluster template remains possible through the
CLI and API. This supports the case where you need an identical version of an
older cluster created.

See :ref:`supported-kubernetes-versions` for more information, and upgrade
your 1.31 clusters.
