Upgrade to the Block Storage service
====================================

With this release there have been some changes to the Block storage service. 
The following is a list of features and changes that are included in this release: 

Changes to the block storage service
------------------------------------

- The latest API microversion supported by the Block Storage Service has been updated 
  from v3.59 to v3.64. For more information on the API changes, see the 
  `API Microversion History`_.

- Fixed a race condition between the `delete attachment` and `delete volume` operations, that used 
  to leave deleted volumes sometimes stuck as attached to deleted instances.

Deprecations and removals
-------------------------

- The deprecated Block Storage V2 API has been removed. This should not cause any issues as the V3 API 
  has been the default in the client libraries for some time; if you are running into issues using the 
  Block Storage Service, make sure you are using the V3 API.
