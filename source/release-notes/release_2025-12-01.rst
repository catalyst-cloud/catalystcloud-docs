=================
Object Storage O2
=================

We have added a new container replication policy to the Object Storage service.

The policy uses erasure coding to allow for the recovery of the data even if
a portion is lost.  The policy only stores a single copy of the data spread
across the region, making the storage cost cheaper.  The policy is available in
the NZ-POR-1 region.
