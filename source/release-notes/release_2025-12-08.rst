Magnum Cluster Templates
------------------------

We have released cluster templates for Kubernetes v1.31.14, v1.32.10, v1.33.6
and v1.34.2.

These templates most notably patch several container escape vulnerabilities in
runc. See the :ref:`supported-kubernetes-versions` section of our documentation
for more information.


Magnum Cluster Deletion
-----------------------

Magnum now performs automatic deletion of unused cluster resources, such as
load balancers and floating IPs.

Note that persistent volumes are not affected at this time and will require
manual deletion. See :ref:`cluster-deletion` for more information.
