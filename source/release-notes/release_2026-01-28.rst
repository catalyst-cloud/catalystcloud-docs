======================
Volume Type Conversion
======================

Block storage volumes can now be converted between types in-place, provided
they are not attached to a server. This includes migrating between standard
and NVMe storage types, as well as the different tiers of NVMe.

For details on how to do this please refer to :ref:`Migrating Volumes
<migrating-volumes>`.
