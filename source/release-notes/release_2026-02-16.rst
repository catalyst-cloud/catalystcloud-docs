Catalyst Cloud Alarm Service
****************************

The :ref:`Catalyst Cloud Alarm Service <alarm>` has been upgraded.
See below for customer-facing changes.

New user roles
==============

New user roles have been added for the Alarm Service, which can be used to grant non-privileged
users read-only or read-write access to alarms in your project:

* :ref:`Alarm Member <alarm_member_role>` (``alarm_member``)
* :ref:`Alarm Reader <alarm_reader_role>` (``alarm_reader``)
* :ref:`Alarm State Reader <alarm_state_reader_role>` (``alarm_state_reader``)

This is useful for granting access to the Alarm Service for service users or
application credentials e.g. for monitoring purposes.

For more information on configuring user roles, see :ref:`Access Control <access_control>`.
