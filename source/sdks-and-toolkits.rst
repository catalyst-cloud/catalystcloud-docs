CLI Tools and SDKs

The command line tools are a set of packages that allow you to interact with
the Catalyst Cloud from your command line. These are important, as the release
schedule for the Catalyst Cloud is structured so that new features are always
added to the APIs and command line first. Meaning if you are wanting to take
advantage of all the cloud has to offer; these command line tools are
a necessity.

The following sections cover the installation process of the required
dependencies on several operating systems including linux based systems, Mac OS
and Windows. The process is similar for most of the systems, however Windows
based systems require a few extra steps to make sure that the tools are
installed in the correct way.
Both of these sections cover the installation, configuration and general use of
the tools; providing information on some of the basic commands that you will
be using.

The other sections cover information on our APIs and specific toolkits that are
available to you, should you choose.
