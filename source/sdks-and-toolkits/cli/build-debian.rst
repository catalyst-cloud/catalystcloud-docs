To install the Catalyst Cloud CLI tools on Debian or Ubuntu,
in addition to Python, the ``build-essential`` package must also be installed.

Run the following command to install it:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

This installs a full C/C++ compiler toolchain, which allows you to install
some dependencies of the Catalyst Cloud CLI tools that must be compiled upon
installation.
