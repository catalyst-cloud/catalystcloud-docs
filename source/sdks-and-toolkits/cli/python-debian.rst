Run the following commands to install Python on your system, and additional packages
required for managing virtual environments:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-venv

Now run the following command to check that the ``python3`` command is usable.

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 --version

If the installed Python version is printed, Python is working correctly.

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3 --version
  Python 3.12.4
