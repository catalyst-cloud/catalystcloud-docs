.. note::

  To install Python on macOS, you will need to have installed
  `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode>`_ first.

While `Python for macOS <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos>`_
can be installed directly from the website, we recommend using a
package manager such as `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_.

Once Homebrew is installed, just run the following command to install Python:

.. code-block:: bash

  brew install python

Now run the following command to check that the ``python`` command is usable.

.. code-block:: bash

  python --version

If the installed Python version is printed, Python is working correctly.

.. code-block:: console

  $ python --version
  Python 3.12.4
