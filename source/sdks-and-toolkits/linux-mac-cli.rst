Installation on Linux and Mac
*****************************

When installing the CLI using pip, it is recommended to use a python virtual
environment to contain the required dependencies. The examples below all make
reference to the use of a virtual environment. If you require more information
on the basic functions of the python virtual environment, please refer to the
:ref:`python-virtual-env` tutorial.

Operating system specific steps
===============================

Here is an outline for installing the Openstack command line tools on the
common Linux/Unix based systems. This includes OSX as it runs a BSD based
system.

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Ubuntu 20.04

        .. code-block:: bash

          # Make sure the package cache is up to date and ensure you have
          # Python3 installed
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-dev

          # create a virtual environment using the Python3 virtual environment module
          python3 -m venv venv

          # activate the virtual environment
          source venv/bin/activate

          # install the Openstack commandline tools into the virtual environment

Using docker (experimental)
===========================

The Catalyst Cloud CLI is available as a Docker container that is easy to use,
packaging the command line interface and all its dependencies.

This tool requires Docker to be installed to function. You can find
`instructions on how to install and configure Docker here`_. You can run the
``docker ps`` command to confirm Docker has been successfully installed.

Run the following command to install the Catalyst Cloud CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

  bash <(wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catalyst-cloud/openstackclient-container/master/fetch-installer.sh) -a ccloud -u https://api.cloud.catalyst.net.nz:5000/v3


.. Note::

  Our documentation currently refers to the CLI command as ``openstack``. When
  using the containerised version of the CLI, this command must be replaced with
  ``ccloud`` in the provided examples.

If you are intending to use the containerised tools you will need to acquire
an openRC file for authentication. To get a copy of the your projects openrc
file, select the dropdown in the upper right corner of the dashboard and click
on ``OpenStack RC for Linux/macOS``. Select ``Save As`` when prompted, and
select the location on your machine to save this file to.

If you need more information on using the file see :ref:`source-rc-file`.

.. _upgrading-the-cli:

Upgrading the CLI
==================

To keep the command line tools up to date, you will need to perform upgrades
on them after changes have come out. The following code snippet will upgrade
all of the tools listed above;
make sure that you have activated your virtual environment before running the
command below:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --upgrade pip \
  python-openstackclient \
  python-ceilometerclient \
  python-heatclient \
  python-neutronclient \
  python-swiftclient \
  python-octaviaclient \
  python-magnumclient \
  aodhclient

Configuration on Linux and Mac
******************************

.. _configuring-the-cli:

.. Warning::

  Prior to using the CLI, ensure you are working from a whitelisted IP address.
  More information can be found :ref:`here <access-and-whitelist>`

.. _source-rc-file:

Source an openstack RC file
===========================

When no configuration arguments are passed, the OpenStack client tools will try
to obtain their configuration from environment variables. To help you define
these variables, the cloud dashboard allows you to download an OpenStack RC
file from which you can easily source the required configuration.

To download an OpenStack RC file from the dashboard:

* Log in to your project on the dashboard and select your preferred region.

* From the left hand menu select "API Access" and click on
  "Download OpenStack RC File". Save the "OpenStack RC for Linux/macOS" file
  on to the host where the client tools are going to be used from.

* Source the configuration from the OpenStack RC file:

  .. code-block:: bash

    source projectname-openrc.sh

* When prompted for a password, enter the password of the user who downloaded
  the file. Note that your password is not displayed on the screen as you type
  it in.

  * If you have MFA enabled on your account, this is also where you input your
    code. If you do not have MFA enabled then simply hit ``ENTER``
    
  .. warning::

    You should never type in your password on the command line (or pass it as
    an argument to the client tools), because the password will be stored in
    plain text in the shell history file. This is unsafe and could allow a
    potential attacker to compromise your credentials.

* You can confirm the configuration works by running a simple command, such as
  ``openstack network list`` and ensuring it returns no errors.

.. Note::

  You are also able to download the Openstack RC file from the top-right
  corner where your login details are display as shown below:

.. image:: assets/RC-file-download.png
  :align: right

Difference between OpenRC for Linux/macOS and for Windows
==========================================================

You will notice that when you go to download the OpenRC file from the
dashboard there are 2 version available. One that is for Linux and Mac based
systems, and one that is for Windows. The reason for this is because Windows
Powershell works differently than the Linux and Mac equivalent.

When authenticating with the linux/macOS open RC, you need to supply a password
and MFA if you have it. If not, then you hit enter to
continue and you are issued a token for authentication. This token lasts up to
12 hours before you need to authenticate your details again. Powershell, does
not work with this functionality and as such, if you do not have MFA then you
need to authenticate only with your password using the ``--NoToken`` flag.
This is discussed more in the :ref:`windows-configuration` section.

This means that for Windows users authenticating without MFA, you are storing
your password in your command line environment. This is not as secure as using
a token, but this does mean that you will not have to *re-authenticate* because
of an expired token.

******************************
Using the CLI on Linux and Mac
******************************

This page assumes that you have installed the python virtual environment and
other dependencies from the :ref:`installing_cli_os` page earlier in this
section of the documentation. If you have, then the following should make
sense. If you want more information about how to use the python virtual
environment then please check the :ref:`activate-venv` section of our
documentation under tutorials.


**If you installed the CLI using pip:**

1. Activate your virtual environment.
2. :ref:`source-rc-file`
3. Invoke the CLI with the ``openstack`` command

**If you installed the CLI using docker:**

1. :ref:`source-rc-file`
2. Invoke the CLI with the ``ccloud`` alias anywhere the ``openstack`` command
   is otherwise used.


For a reference of all commands supported by the CLI, refer to the `OpenStack
Client documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient>`_.

The next step
=============

We highly recommend that if you are going to be using the CLI often that you
take the time to go through the documentation section on :ref:`setting up your
first instance <using-the-command-line-interface>`, using the CLI method. It
gives you a great step-by-step process to how to create an instance but also
teaches you the common commands found in openstack and the CLI.
