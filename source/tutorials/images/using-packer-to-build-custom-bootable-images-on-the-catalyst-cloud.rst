Using packer to build custom bootable images on the Catalyst Cloud
##################################################################

This tutorial shows you how to use `Packer`_ to build custom bootable images on
the Catalyst Cloud. Packer is an open source tool developed by `Hashicorp`_ for
creating machine images for multiple platforms from a single source
configuration.

Packer makes use of builders and provisioners to create custom bootable
images.

********
Builders
********

Packer supports a number of `builders`_ for different target platforms
including Amazon EC2 AMI images, VirtualBox and VMware. When building images
for the Catalyst Cloud you will be using the `OpenStack builder`_.

************
Provisioners
************

`Provisioners`_ provide a way to configure a base image such that a new custom
image can be created. Many provisioners are available, including shell
provisioners and provisioners that use DevOps tools like Ansible, Puppet and
Chef.

*****
Setup
*****

This tutorial assumes that you have sourced an openrc file, as described at
:ref:`source-rc-file`. This is required in order for the `OpenStack builder`_
to interact with the Catalyst Cloud image service.

You will also need an appropriate security group to allow SSH access for the
temporary build machine that Packer will create.

Next you need to install Packer. Packer is a single go binary, so this is a
simple process:

.. code-block:: console

 $ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/0.10.1/packer_0.10.1_linux_amd64.zip
 $ unzip packer_0.10.1_linux_amd64.zip
 $ ./packer --version
 0.10.1

*****************************
Create a Packer template file
*****************************

`Templates`_ are JSON files that configure the builders and provisioners that
you will use to create our custom image.

In this example, you will create a basic template that can be invoked with the
``packer build`` command. It will create an instance in the Catalyst cloud, and
once the instance is running, copy a script to it and run the script using SSH.
Once the script has finished running, it will create a new Catalyst Cloud image
that includes the changes you have made. Once this process is complete, it will
clean up after itself so that only the new image remains.

In this example, you will be using the shell provisioner to update the packages
on an Ubuntu 16.04 machine to the latest versions. You will then build a
`golang`_ application called `ssllabs-scan`_ from source.

.. code-block:: json

 {
   "builders": [{
     "type": "openstack",
     "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
     "image_name": "ubuntu1604_packer_test_1",
     "source_image": "49fb1409-c88e-4750-a394-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "flavor": "c1.c1r1",
     "security_groups": ["example-sg"],
     "floating_ip_pool": "public-net"
   }],
   "provisioners": [{
     "type": "shell",
     "inline": [
       "sleep 30",
       "sudo apt-get update",
       "sudo apt-get upgrade -y",
       "sudo apt-get install -y golang-go make",
       "git clone https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan",
       "cd /home/ubuntu/ssllabs-scan/",
       "make"
     ]
   }]
 }

*****************
Building an image
*****************

Now you can build a new image called ``ubuntu1604_packer_test_1`` using this
template:

.. code-block:: console

 $ ./packer build domain-check-packer.json
 openstack output will be in this colour.

 Build 'openstack' finished.

 ==> Builds finished. The artefacts of successful builds are:
 --> openstack: An image was created: e81c38a0-6fbf-4f62-b873-xxxxxxxxxxxx

.. note::

 The process of building a new image takes some time, so now would be a good time to make a cup of tea.

****************
Booting an image
****************

Once the packer build command is complete, your newly build image should be
available:

.. code-block:: console

***********************************************
Using Packer with Windows on the Catalyst Cloud
***********************************************

.. note::

  At this time, due to a known issue in the Catalyst Cloud, it is not possible
  to deploy a Windows image using Packer directly from the publicly available
  Windows image.

  In order to overcome this limitation, it is necessary to deploy a new
  temporary Windows instance in the Catalyst Cloud. When launching this
  instance, you need to say Yes to ``Create New Volume`` when selecting
  the ``Instance Source``.

  Once the image has booted successfully, take a snapshot of it. This new
  snapshot can now be used as the source image for your Packer build. It is
  not necessary to keep the temporary Windows instance once the snapshot has
  been successfully taken.


It is possible to use Packer to create custom Windows images. This requires
some changes in approach as the tools and connection details are those typical
of Windows technologies.

The first change is in the ``builders`` section of the packer build file. Here
you need to add the settings to specify the connection type and the credentials
to use on this connection.

Below is an example of the new communicator settings. These make use of the
Windows Remote Management feature. This uses the WS-Management Protocol, which
is based on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

.. code-block:: bash

    "builders": [{
        ...

        "communicator": "winrm",
        "winrm_username": "Administrator",
        "winrm_password": "uUteQ419EPFUMoE4zaTE",

        ...
    }],


Setting ``"communicator"`` to ``"winrm"`` is mandatory in order for this to
work as expected. The username is required, but it does not have to be
``Administrator``, though for a Windows instance it makes sense to have a known
administration account.

The other important change is the creation of a ``userdata`` script that is run
by the builders section of the build file. The purpose of this userdata
section is to configure the WinRM access and define the user so that Packer is
able to connect to the instance once it has been created.

The reference to the userdata script needs to be added to the builders section
and provide the location of the script that needs to be run.

.. code-block:: bash

    "builders": [{
        ...

        "user_data_file": "./userdata_setup.ps1",

        ...
    }],

The userdata itself is a Windows command-line/PowerShell script that configures
various settings required to allow remote connectivity via WinRM.

.. code-block:: console

    #ps1_sysnative
    wmic UserAccount set PasswordExpires=False
    net user Administrator uUteQ419EPFUMoE4zaTE
    cmd /C netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
    winrm quickconfig -q
    winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="500"}'
    winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'
    winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
    winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
    winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
    net stop winrm
    net start winrm

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine -Force

.. warning::

  The userdata script disables the Windows firewall and also sets the
  Administrator password using plain text, which means it could be recovered
  from the file system.

  These two points present a huge risk and should both be addressed to prevent
  any subsequent compromise of security.

Once the userdata file has been created and the Packer build file edited
accordingly, simply run the Packer build command as discussed above.

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./packer build windows-build-file.json
