Creating an instance with interfaces on different networks with Heat
####################################################################

This tutorial assumes the following:

* You have created a basic network setup in the Catalyst Cloud.
* You have installed the OpenStack command line tools and sourced an
  openrc file, as explained at :ref:`command-line-interface`.
* You have a basic understanding of Heat templates as shown at
  :ref:`launching-your-first-instance-using-heat`.

Introduction
============

In this tutorial, you will find out how to create an additional network in a
project that already has a private network, and then create a server that has
interfaces on the existing private network and the newly created one.

You will need to delve into the mysteries of 'cloud-init' a little to achieve
this. You'll also learn how to perform another useful customisation -
changing who the default user is for an instance.

Heat template
=============

We need to create a network, and a subnet - and then boot an instance using
these plus an already existing private network. Unfortunately, it is not
sufficient simply to create networks and provide these to the instance at
creation time - only the first network is properly configured if this approach
is taken (this could be viewed as a bug). This can be worked around using the
the user_data property along with cloud-init:
