Bootstrapping puppet from heat
##############################

This tutorial assumes the following:

* You have created a basic network setup in the Catalyst Cloud.
* You have access to a server that is acting as the Puppet Master.
* You have installed the OpenStack command line tools and sourced an
  openrc file, as explained at :ref:`command-line-interface`.
* You have a basic understanding of Heat templates as shown at
  :ref:`launching-your-first-instance-using-heat`.

************
Introduction
************

In this tutorial, you will see how to add a new server to an existing
Catalyst Cloud network and configure it with `Puppet`_ and have it check in to
the Puppet Master.

To achieve this, you will create a ``heat`` template that will handle the
creation of the instance and then run a nested cloud-config script via
`cloud-init`_ that will handle the provisioning of Puppet on the new server.

.. _Puppet: https://puppetlabs.com/
.. _cloud-init: http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

*****
Setup
*****

You will make use of Heat template to deploy a single instance into an existing
network hosted in the Catalyst Cloud. In order to make this work, you need to
retrieve the relevant network IDs and add them into the template.

The two networks you will be connecting to are front-end and public-net. To
find these values, you need to run the following OpenStack commands.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack network list -c ID -c Name
  +--------------------------------------+------------+
  | ID                                   | Name       |
  +--------------------------------------+------------+
  | 74be55e6-b303-473c-ac1a-185c39b6f7b3 | mgmt-net   |
  | 849ab1e9-7ac5-4618-8801-e6176fcccf30 | public-net |
  | e7adca02-5b8b-4c2e-9946-2e2eff55997a | front-end  |
  +--------------------------------------+------------+

You also need to know the ID of the front-end network subnet, in order to
create a port and assign a floating IP to the server.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack subnet list -c ID -c Name
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+
  | ID                                   | Name        |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+
  | 279a71ca-6772-4235-bbb4-c0ddf2029f67 | front-end   |
  | 450cb9f7-b297-40fe-a855-fc187bb27b2a | mgmt-subnet |
  +--------------------------------------+-------------+

Implementation
**************

This snippet ( included in the template below ) is responsible for passing
the cloud-config script puppet_bootstrap.yaml to cloud-init

.. code-block:: yaml

  user_data_format: RAW
   user_data:
    get_file: /home/user1/cloud/puppet_bootstrap.yaml

Here is the Heat template that is responsible for creating the new instance.
The network ID values found previously have been added to the relevant
parameters as defaults. It is also possible to pass these values in as
arguments from the command line, as shown `here`_.

    It also uses a cloud-init script to bootstrap the server with Puppet.

This is the ``cloud-init`` script that is called via the ``user-data``
command. It ensures that the Puppet package is installed and sets some
basic configuration to ensure that the server can identify itself and
locate the Puppet Master.

It performs the following tasks:

* creates a host entry for the Puppet Master
* adds environment and Puppet Master server variables to puppet.conf
* runs Puppet agent with an optional 120 second wait for the certificate
  request to be signed by the Puppet Master

.. code-block:: yaml

  #cloud-config

  # This is an example of how to have Puppet agent installed and run
  # when the instance boots for the first time.
  # It needs to passed in valid YAML format to user-data when starting
  # the instance.

  # bootcmd required as it runs very early in the boot process
  # add a host entry so server can correctly identify itself
  bootcmd:
    - echo 127.0.0.1 server1.example.co.nz server1 >> /etc/hosts

  # Install additional packages on first boot
  # if packages are specified then apt_update will be set to true and run
  # first
  packages:
   - puppet

  puppet:
   # Every key present in the conf object will be added to puppet.conf:
   # [name]
   # subkey=value
    conf:
      agent:
        server: "puppet.example.co.nz"
        environment: dev

  # add Puppet Master host entry and do initial Puppet run
  runcmd:
    - echo 10.20.40.12 puppet.example.co.nz puppet >> /etc/hosts
    - puppet agent --test --server puppet.example.co.nz --waitforcert 120

  # Capture all subprocess output into a logfile
  # Useful for troubleshooting cloud-init issues
  output: {all: '| tee -a /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'}

*******************
Creating the server
*******************

To create the server, run the following Heat command. This will create a new
server called server1 in a stack named puppet-slave-stack

.. code-block:: bash

  openstack stack create -t /home/user1/cloud/puppet_slave.yaml puppet-slave-stack

Here's how to check the progress of your deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

  openstack console log show server1

**********
Final note
**********

Unless your Puppet Master is configured to automatically sign agent certificate
requests, you will need to sign your new server's cert before the first Puppet
run will complete.
