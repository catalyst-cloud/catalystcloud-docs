Deploying matrix synapse on Catalyst Cloud using ansible
########################################################

This tutorial assumes the following:

* Completed the first-instance Ansible tutorial
* Comfortable using SSH to access an instance and run commands.
* Have an instance set up already to host your chat server, with port 8448
  open in addition to ports 80 and 443.
* A domain with an A record with the hostname :code:`@` on the instance **OR**
* A sub-domain  with an A record with the hostname set to the subdomain and a
  SRV record with the hostname :code:`_matrix._tcp` pointing to port
  :code:`8448` on the target instance.

Introduction
============

Matrix is an open source, decentralized, and encrypted communication protocol.
Data is not necessarily stored on a single server but in all servers
participating in a particular room. The goal is to make it as easy to
communicate as sending an email, meaning there is no requirement on using a
particular device or application, just support for the Matrix protocol.

Servers in matrix can be federated, allowing your server to communicate
with other servers and your identity can be stored on your own homeserver,
whilst allowing that identity to be used elsewhere.

Matrix also has support for bridging to other protocols (such as IRC!),
however that is outside of the scope of this tutorial. If you're interested
you can find more information at matrix.org/docs/guides/faq.html

We're going to use Ansible to automatically install Synapse, the reference
server implementation of the Matrix protocol. It is implemented in Python and,
at the time of writing, is the most installed Matrix homeserver implementation.
We're not going set up an instance on Catalyst Cloud as this has already been
covered by the first-instance tutorials.

Creating our playbook
=====================

We want to begin by adding our hostname so that Ansible knows what to do with
it. Open :code:`/etc/ansible/hosts` on your machine in your preferred text
editor (this will require sudo/root access) and add the following block to
the end:

.. code-block:: yaml

  [chatservers]
  mydomain.com ansible_user:ubuntu

This will tell Ansible which set of hosts to run our playbook on. If we
wanted to deploy to multiple hosts they could all be added to the chatservers
host group and the same playbook would run on them also.

Beginning the installation
==========================

To begin with we're going to create a new file and save it as
:code:`matrixchat-playbook.yml`

In this file we'll create our play for installing Synapse. To begin with we
need to make sure that Python 2 is installed on the target machine because
Ansible relies on it. Then we'll let it go through the setup stage of
gathering gathering facts about the machine.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Setup the Matrix Server
    hosts: chatservers
    become: yes
    gather_facts: no
    vars:
      server_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    pre_tasks:
      - name: 'Install Python 2'
        raw: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install python-minimal
      - action: setup

We're going to want to use HTTPS later so we'll add the repository for certbot.

.. code-block:: yaml

  tasks:
    - name: Add certbot repo for Let's Encrypt Certs
      apt_repository:
        validate_certs: no
        repo: 'ppa:certbot/certbot'
        state: present

    - name: update aptitude cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

Installing Synapse & dependencies
=================================

We're going to install and build Synapse. To do this we'll need a few
dependencies. We're also doing to install nginx configured as a reverse proxy
to enable web access to the built in matrix client.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Install Synapse Prerequisites and Nginx
    action: apt pkg={{ item }} state=present
    with_items:
      - nginx
      - python2.7-dev
      - build-essential
      - libffi-dev
      - python-pip
      - python-setuptools
      - sqlite3
      - libssl-dev
      - python-virtualenv
      - libjpeg-dev
      - libxslt1-dev
      - python-certbot-nginx

  - name: Install Synapse
    shell: |
      pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install --upgrade setuptools
      pip install https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master

Applying configurations
=======================

Before our system can do anything, we need to configure it. We're going
to point our server at port 8008 as this is the port our matrix client runs at.
We don't need to configure an SSL certificate or anything like that just yet,
we'll do that later. We also need to enable the configuration and restart
nginx.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Configure Nginx
    copy:
      dest: "/etc/nginx/sites-available/matrixchat"
      content: |
        server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            root /var/www/html;
            index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

            server_name {{ server_name }};

            location / {
                return 302 https://$server_name/_matrix/client/;
            }

            location /_matrix {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8008;
            }

            location ~ /.well-known {
                allow all;
            }
        }

  - name: Enable nginx configuration
    file:
      src: "/etc/nginx/sites-available/matrixchat"
      dest: "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/matrixchat"
      state: link
    notify:
      - Restart nginx

We'll also need to start synapse, generate the keys and configuration and
also modify the configuration to allow registration.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Create Synapse Directory
    file:
      path: /home/ubuntu/.synapse
      state: directory

  - name: Start Synapse
    shell: |
      python -m synapse.app.homeserver \
        --server-name {{ server_name }} \
        --config-path /home/ubuntu/.synapse/homeserver.yaml \
        --generate-config \
        --report-stats=no

  - name: Enable Registration
    lineinfile:
      path: /home/ubuntu/.synapse/homeserver.yaml
      regexp: '^enable_registration: False'
      line: 'enable_registration: True'
    notify:
      - Restart Synapse
      - Restart nginx

Once you've reached this point, and hopefully you've been following along
and saving each block of code as we go, should be able to run the playbook like
this: :code:`ansible-playbook matrixchat-playbook.yml` from a terminal.

Hopefully nothing breaks and you should be able to go navigate a web browser to
:code:`http://yourdomain.com/_matrix/client/` and see the login for the
default matrix client. This is served over http and currently HTTPS will fail.
We'll set that up next.

Free HTTPS with certbot and let's encrypt
=========================================

We want to secure communication between users and our server, so to do so
we'll get an SSL certificate. Earlier when we were installing dependencies
and software, we also installed an nginx certbot package. Certbot is a tool
for getting Let's Encrypt certificates without too much hassle.

To begin, SSH into your compute instance and run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ certbot --nginx -d www.example.com -d example.com

You'll be greeted by a couple of prompts that you'll want to read and answer.
This automatically modifies the nginx configuration we created earlier. Once
this is done we need to restart nginx:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ systemctl restart nginx.service

Navigate to :code:`https://yourdomain.com` and you should see the exact same
thing as before.

Registering a user
==================

Our server needs users, you can register a user via the web client, or you can
create one using the command below. This will also prompt if you would
like the user you are creating to become an admin (for this server) as well.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ register_new_matrix_user -c ~/.synapse/homeserver.yaml https://localhost:8448

Testing
========

Once you've created a user, attempt to login. If you'd like, we can test
server federation by navigating to another client such as Riot,
located at https://riot.im/app/

Check the radio button to use a custom server and adjust both server fields to
your homeservers address and attempt to login with your credentials.
If this works, then your server is federated and you can go and participate on
other servers with your personal identity.
